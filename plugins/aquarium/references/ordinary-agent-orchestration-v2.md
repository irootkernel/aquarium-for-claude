# Ordinary native agent orchestration (retained v2)

Navigation links identify current owners. Admitted v2 sessions retain their original role instructions and report identifiers. Use the [current contract](ordinary-agent-orchestration.md) for new workflows.

## Contract status and authority

These ordinary v2 interfaces govern the aligned candidate handlers, role
instructions, helpers and five bundled Procedures. Installed handlers and
immutable sessions retain their admitted released contracts until an authorized
managed update and compatible successor. Source alignment does not establish
installed functionality or upgrade success.

Operational roles use supported native subagents of the current Primary's harness: a Claude Code Primary dispatches its Workers and its Judge as Claude Code subagents through this host's own subagent mechanism. Request the `opus` model for each unless the user names another supported model, so Fable runs only on the user's explicit request, because a subagent dispatched without a model inherits the session's; preserve any other option the user explicitly selects that the mechanism supports. Unavailable internal model telemetry does not block ordinary work. Selected technical reviews keep their own provider and topology, including a reviewer from another AI family that Herdr runs for a Claude Code workflow.

When the Primary's assignment hands a subagent a step that an Aquarium skill owns — however its text phrases the hand-off, including a Procedure node instruction that names the skill bare, such as `Use task-implement` — resolve that skill's `SKILL.md` in this plugin (`../skills/<name>/SKILL.md` from this reference), put its absolute path into the assignment, and have the subagent read the file in full and follow it, because a subagent cannot load a gated skill through the Skill tool.

The harness executes agents; ordinary Podway Actions record work and evidence
without authenticating native calls. Declared formal delegation still requires
the integration and receipts in the [formal v1 contract](formal-agent-orchestration-v1.md)
and [mapping profiles](native-agent-mappings.md). Preserve v1 interpretation and
digest domains; never fabricate its fields or relabel an admitted formal session.

## Roles and assessment boundaries

| Role | Responsibility | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestrator / Primary | Resolve scope and authority, assign agents, reconcile results and make permitted workflow Decisions | Own approval conversations and lifecycle operations; preserve checks, selected reviews and exact grants; never attribute delegated acceptance to Master |
| Worker | Perform assigned research, implementation or documentation with refinement and verification; return actual artifacts, results and gaps | Stay within assigned effects; only one mutating Worker operates in a shared checkout at a time |
| Judge | Independently assess due obligations against original requirements, current artifacts and actual evidence | Report only; no implementation, check execution, nested dispatch, lifecycle mutation or grant of authority |

Keep one logical Judge throughout an invocation when supported. Internal Epic
validation uses that Judge; independent cold validation starts a fresh Judge.
A recovered or replacement Judge establishes current applicability independently.
Persistent identity and full executor history are not prerequisites for a fresh
independent assessment. The Primary cannot label its own assessment a Judge result.

Assess the plan, coherent delivery with its refinement and verification, and
completion after admitted technical review. The Procedures express these groups
using supported Actions, selected evidence and Primary Decisions:

| Workflow | Meaningful assessment boundaries |
| --- | --- |
| Task | Approved plan; implementation or documentation delivery with refinement and required checks; final completion with admitted review and settled corrections |
| Epic / Goal | Current member or owned correction outcome; final integration and overall purpose, including review and internal validation where due |
| Validation | Independent original-source audit or re-audit; each correction group with checks before settlement; final integrated outcome after admitted review |
| Design | Context and discovery; draft, challenge and quality evidence; approved application with verification and final design outcome |
| War-room | Baseline and investigation for cause/scope Decisions; proposal and quality evidence; approved document or verified no-change delivery and final diagnosis outcome |

Operational bookkeeping and report assembly do not create another Judge cycle.
Judge reports are never recursively judged. The Primary checks completeness,
source coverage and applicability without repeating the semantic assessment.

Reconcile assigned criteria with canonical sources, including omitted criteria
and applicable parent constraints. Each criterion retains its source, evidence,
provenance, gap and state: `met`, `unmet`, `unverified` or `not-applicable`.
A phase assesses every due obligation while preserving the actual global state
of future obligations. Whole-goal passage requires every mandatory criterion to
be met or legitimately inapplicable. Unassessed parts of compound criteria remain
unverified. Faithful negative audit or quality output reaches its original gap
router without claiming repair or overall achievement.

Treat review findings as hypotheses until a due requirement and reachable user
impact support them. Preserve actual defects and missing required evidence;
optional future hardening does not block acceptance. Request more information
only when it can change that decision. Scope, mandatory checks, selected review,
correction authority, actual approvals and commit boundaries remain independent.

Source-only adaptive preparation may carry original source references in `work`
and selection, coverage and exact prepared-definition data in `target`, under the
[shared adaptive preparation contract](adaptive-procedures.md#selection-and-source-only-preparation).
These remain ordinary assignment/plan data. Reconcile full original sources and
compound criteria independently; a generated coverage plan supplies no second
requirements authority or Judge passage. Task, Goal, Validation, Design and Diagnosis now use [mapped adaptive execution](adaptive-execution.md). Exact changed/new suitability can use the same due Task
plan Judge when its target covers both scopes. Preserve full global future gaps
and a separate passing phase result; a pre-start definition assessment does not
claim product delivery. The shared helper returns a truthful pre-session ordinary
assignment and imports the actual report, without new receipts or private identity
requirements. Known Goal reuse adds no plan Judge. In-session re-entry uses an
existing affected planning/Judge route and never relabels a later call pre-start.

## Ordinary v2 documents

These Aquarium documents are not native wire schemas. Use the exact identifiers
below and retain source provenance. Runtime documents follow
[evidence residency](evidence-residency.md), without a tracked execution log,
central state file, collector, scheduler, provider allowlist or retry quota.

Every document carries these common fields:

| Field | Required meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | One ordinary v2 identifier below; never relabel v1 |
| `work` | Repository and canonical work identity, objective, original requirement sources and their revision or approved basis |
| `target` | Current artifact basis, applicable base revision, included/excluded scope and identification of relevant candidate bytes and check inputs |
| `authority` | Actual envelope, allowed/excluded effects, applicable approvals and grants, consumed and remaining review/correction authority |
| `procedure` | Available public session, Procedure, node, attempt and goal context; explicit inapplicability for an authorized non-Podway path |
| `native` | Current harness, available public agent/task handles and observed lifecycle state; explicit unknown values for unavailable records |
| `evidence` | Readable original inputs, actual results, checks performed or omitted with reasons, provenance and access limits |
| `gaps` | Remaining due work, missing evidence, uncertain effects or capability gaps and their next owner; empty only when none remain |

Use Git objects or locally checked artifact content identities appropriate to
the claim, including relevant owned dirty or untracked bytes. Planning can name
the current basis before deliverables exist; delivery and verdicts identify the
actual candidate they cover. Local digests prove content identity only.
Material candidate, requirement or check-input changes invalidate affected
assessments and checks; carry unaffected evidence only with current applicability.
Unavailable identity/model records remain unknown without blocking startup.
Missing evidence for a due product obligation still prevents its pass.

| Schema | Producer and additional content |
| --- | --- |
| `aquarium.assignment/v2` | Primary adds `role` (`worker` or `judge`), purpose, `instructions`, `deliverables`, `success_criteria` and `checkpoint`; states mutation/report-only boundaries and supplies original sources and selected evidence |
| `aquarium.worker-handoff/v2` | Worker adds originating `assignment`, delivered/missing `deliverables`, exact `changed_artifacts`, actual `results`, feedback/settlement state and `next_owner`; separates firsthand and supplied evidence |
| `aquarium.judge-assessment/v2` | Judge adds `assignment` and applicable Worker result references, `checkpoint`, reconciled `criteria`, `applicability`, technical-review basis/limits and `verdict` (`pass`, `rework`, `evidence-needed`); nonfinal `checkpoint_result` is `pass`, `fail` or `inconclusive` for due obligations |
| `aquarium.orchestration-checkpoint/v2` | Primary adds last observed native/workflow state, known assignments/results, `pending_operations`, current criteria/candidate, consumed grants/ordinals, frozen findings or correction scope and `next_owner` |

The optional helper accepts nonempty `work`, `target`, `authority` and `native`
objects, `procedure` as an object or `null`, `evidence` and `gaps` lists, and the
assignment fields above. `authority.allowed` and `authority.excluded` are lists
of strings. Preparation returns a copied `aquarium.assignment/v2`; rendering
returns `aquarium.prepared-dispatch/v2` with `dispatch_text`, without formal
native binding fields. Final Judge reports state their actual goal outcome;
phase-only reports cannot supply final passage by relabeling.

Ordinary dispatch may carry the assignment through supported text or structured
input. Frozen role/dependency snapshots, effective configuration digests and a
preparation helper are not admission requirements. A summary cannot substitute
for required source access. Preserve failed, omitted and inconclusive checks and
established/evidence gaps together. Worker delivery supplies no Judge or user
acceptance. Provider reports keep their original rows; Judge provenance cannot
replace technical-provider coverage. A negative verdict grants no new effect.

## Recovery and breaking updates

Reconnect known agents through supported native operations first. Reconcile an
unknown dispatch, result or external effect before replay. Before replacing a
mutating Worker, establish settlement of that Worker and relevant descendants.
If public evidence cannot establish safe settlement, stop that mutation and name
the concrete missing capability. Full transcripts, private executor history and
configuration digests are not ordinary recovery prerequisites.

A Judge may reconnect or be replaced with a fresh independent agent supplied
the original criteria, current artifacts, prior gaps and remaining authority.
Restoring an old pass alone cannot establish current pass. Replacement does not
reset grants, review ordinals or stopped-work boundaries. If native subagents
are unavailable, report the actual capability gap and obtain a supported
alternative without silently switching harnesses or inventing independence.

Preserve the five stable canonical Procedure IDs alongside distinct qualified adaptive identities; the current source versions are Task
`32`, Goal `35`, Validation `34`, Design `11` and War-room `11`. Preserve exact
prior sources, customized bytes, immutable sessions and historical reports,
including role/configuration/task/result/Podway digest domains. Recognized prior
digests prove provenance, not compatibility with the new graph. Existing formal
sessions retain their receipt obligations and supported released continuation.
Authorized managed updates and compatible successors require reconciliation of
pending effects and writer settlement; never overwrite customizations or migrate
an existing session by relabeling it.

Follow the target repository's development, installation and verification policy,
including its designated environment for candidate installation and checks.
Verification evidence applies only to its recorded harness, candidate and
environment; results for other harnesses remain unverified and do not gate
ordinary admission. Keep structural and synthetic results, development
functionality, candidate-bound release acceptance and actual Master acceptance
separate.

## Producer and consumer alignment

These owners implement the ordinary contract together. Helpers remain optional
for ordinary dispatch.

| Owner | Required alignment |
| --- | --- |
| [Task handler](../skills/task-handler/SKILL.md), [Epic handler](../skills/epic-handler/SKILL.md), [Epic validator](../skills/epic-validator/SKILL.md) | Produce assignments/checkpoints and consume actual Worker results and applicable Judge reports; preserve actual acceptance and commit authority |
| [New feature](../skills/new-feature/SKILL.md), [new project](../skills/new-project/SKILL.md), [refactor](../skills/refactor/SKILL.md), [war-room](../skills/war-room/SKILL.md) | Use grouped native roles while preserving proposal, quality, exact-diff, leaf and non-Git boundaries |
| Task phases: [plan](../skills/task-plan/SKILL.md), [implement](../skills/task-implement/SKILL.md), [refine](../skills/task-refine/SKILL.md), [verify](../skills/task-verify/SKILL.md), [document](../skills/task-document/SKILL.md), [review](../skills/task-review/SKILL.md), [close](../skills/task-close/SKILL.md) | Produce v2 handoffs or consume final assessments under a compatible ordinary handler; retain direct-invocation authority |
| [Worker guidance](executor-guidance.md), [Goal Judge](../skills/goal-evaluator/SKILL.md) | Produce v2 reports without formal qualification prerequisites |
| [Shared contract](agent-orchestration.md), [native mappings](native-agent-mappings.md) | Route ordinary v2 separately from formal/historical v1 for the current sources; preserve every existing v1 digest domain |
| [Task](task-orchestration.md), [Epic](epic-orchestration.md), [Validation](validation-orchestration.md), [Design/diagnosis](design-diagnosis-orchestration.md), [node contracts](procedure-node-contracts.md) | Define grouped responsibilities, original evidence, semantic progression and recovery |
| [Five bundled Procedures](../assets/podway/procedures/) | Align Action instructions, item prompts, artifact schemas, evidence selectors and Decision consumers; omit formal `delegation` from ordinary defaults |
| [Assignment preparer](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/prepare_assignment.py), [dispatch renderer](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/render_dispatch.py) | Provide schema-selected ordinary v2 support through minimal `goal-evaluator/scripts/ordinary_assignment_v2.py`; preserve v1 interfaces, outputs, exact bytes and digest domains |
| [Codex binder](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/bind_prepared_delivery.py), [Claude binder](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/bind_claude_delivery.py), [mapper](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/map_native_delivery.py), [capture client](../skills/goal-evaluator/scripts/read_codex_thread.py) | Retain formal/historical contracts and rejection behavior; never synthesize v1 native provenance from ordinary v2 |
| [Setup inspector](../skills/dev-setup/scripts/inspect_tools.py) | Align handler-structure, delegation and preview inspection; classify prior formal/custom sources without rewriting them |
| Repository Procedure tests (`tests/unit/test_procedure_alignment_contracts.py`), setup tests (`tests/test_inspect_tools.py`), runtime fixtures (`tests/podway_runtime_qualification.py`) | Check executable routes, due checks, authority and source classification; preserve separate historical formal receipt coverage |

Existing v1 Worker, Judge and recovery reports have no standalone parser or
renderer: role instructions, workflow references and Procedure items own their
production and consumption. The ordinary module supports assignment input and
rendering only, without a generic report engine or native-call authentication.
Repository package validation (`tests/validate.rb`) remains structural. Prose
matching cannot verify role behavior; actual installed native progression,
failure, rework and recovery require separate functional observations.

Pre-start suitability dispatch preserves preparing-agent observations separately
from the assigned Judge's `native` descriptor. Before actual dispatch, the Judge
handle is explicitly unknown and its lifecycle is not-dispatched. The dispatcher
may supply the actual available Judge handle; copied Worker handles never identify
an independently assigned Judge. This is provenance, not native authentication.
