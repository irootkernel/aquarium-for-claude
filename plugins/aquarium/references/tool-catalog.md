# Development Tool Catalog

This catalog is shared by `dev-setup-global` and `dev-setup`. The global skill owns user-global installation, upgrades, paired skills, services, and global MCP state. The repository skill owns only repository configuration and readiness. Read only the sections needed for the selected components.

Use only the section for a selected tool. Repository instructions override this catalog.

## Shared version and safety policy

- Resolve the latest non-draft, non-prerelease stable release at execution time from the official repository, limited to a tool's supported release line when its section defines one. Display the exact tag and source before installation; never substitute `@latest` after approval.
- Install paired and third-party skills under the configured Claude Code skill root whatever default location an upstream release documents for another host. Check every location this host loads that skill from before installing so setup does not create a duplicate.
- Preserve an already compatible installation unless the user approves an upgrade.
- Diagnose credentials by whether the owning CLI reports readiness. Never print, copy, or persist credential material.
- Keep configuration in each tool's native files. Never create `.aquarium`, a selection manifest, or a shadow version registry.
- A direct unscoped `/aquarium:dev-setup-global` invocation authorizes disclosed read-only official release, tag, and commit metadata lookup for every selected global component; a scoped continuation selects only its named components. For Sanho, Dolgorae, Mulgae, Gaori, Sorage, and Podway, this also includes official Git tree metadata and commit-pinned public raw files for the complete paired-skill comparison below. When Lora or Deslop is selected, official npm metadata lookup for its `skills` installer is included. These exceptions authorize no archive download, clone, upstream-code execution, installation, provider contact, Project registration, or other persistent change. Obtain separate approval for those effects and any network access outside the selected lookup scope.
- Apply the backup policy selected under `Choose a Backup Policy for Existing State` to every approved action that overwrites or removes an existing binary, skill, configuration, service, managed Procedure, or runtime state.

A backup choice requires exact backup and restoration commands plus verification before mutation. A no-backup choice requires the exact loss and recovery boundary in the proposal but no retained copy of the replaced state. It never waives source, checksum, frontmatter, diff, target, or post-install verification, and incoming payload staging is not a backup.

## Complete Paired-Skill Inventory

For each selected paired skill, resolve the supported release tag to its full peeled commit and root Git tree SHA through the official repository. Keep the independent Podway skill commit pin below. Fetch the complete recursive tree from `https://api.github.com/repos/irootkernel/<tool>/git/trees/<tree-sha>?recursive=1`. A truncated response is not a complete inventory: report freshness unverifiable and do not install from it. Select the entire `skills/<skill-name>/` subtree with [this bundled inventory helper](../skills/dev-setup-global/scripts/inspect_skill_inventory.py):

```text
python3 <global-skill-directory>/scripts/inspect_skill_inventory.py --tree-sha <resolved-tree-sha> --skill-path skills/<skill-name> < <ephemeral-tree-json>
```

The helper emits `aquarium-skill-inventory/v1` with the selected tree, skill path, and file rows on success. Invalid metadata or selection returns exit 2 and a structured `error` with code `invalid_inventory`; CLI usage errors use argparse. The helper rejects a mismatched tree, duplicate or unsafe paths, missing `SKILL.md`, symlinks and submodules in the selected skill. It performs no network access or writes. Verify that the tree SHA belongs to the resolved commit before calling it; accepting metadata alone does not establish upstream provenance. Fetch every returned regular file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/<tool>/<full-commit-sha>/skills/<skill-name>/<path>`, URL-encoding path components. Verify each payload's Git blob SHA against the inventory (`SHA-1` of `blob <byte-length>\0` followed by its bytes), record its SHA-256 digest, and validate the skill name in frontmatter. Enumerate the entire source and target trees, reject extra or missing paths and symlinks, and compare every file. Newly added upstream files are required even when the inspector's minimum structural file list does not name them. `configured` from that local probe is structural evidence only, never complete-tree freshness.

Keep fetched payloads ephemeral until the exact installation or replacement is approved. Show the resolved source, complete file inventory, digests, endpoints, and canonical target in that proposal. Install the verified complete tree by an approved atomic move and compare it again afterward. These rules apply independently to both Gaori skills.

## Pin the Skill Installer

For Lora and Deslop, resolve one exact `skills` package version through official `https://registry.npmjs.org/skills` metadata and disclose its package integrity and provenance separately from the upstream skill commit. Use that approved version in every `npx skills@<approved-installer-version>` command. Inspect the selected installer's documented behavior before proposing execution. Disclose its exact npm download and cache effects, skill targets, and every lock-file creation or update path, including user-global or repository-local lock files when that version uses them. Include existing lock-file contents in the proposed diff and backup decision without exposing credentials. Do not assume `--global` means only skill directories are written. If effects cannot be determined, stop before execution. Clone, package download, installer execution and target writes need approval even though selected metadata diagnosis is automatic.

## Choose a Backup Policy for Existing State

When an approved setup plan will first overwrite or remove existing tool, skill, configuration, service, managed Procedure, or runtime state, establish one backup policy for the current setup request. If the user already explicitly requested backups or no backups, adopt that choice without asking again. Otherwise offer `Create and verify backups` and `Proceed without backups`, recommending the backup choice. Do not ask about backups for diagnosis or a new installation that replaces nothing.

Keep the selected policy for later overwrite and removal proposals in the same setup request unless the user changes it. The policy does not authorize any mutation: show and approve every exact replacement or removal. One Ouroboros proposal may cover the listed CLI, plugin integration, MCP, and migration actions; do not request approval again for an action already covered. Never persist the choice in repository or user-global configuration.

For the backup policy, show the exact backup path, commands, verification, and restoration procedure before approval, and stop before mutation if the selected backup cannot be verified. For the no-backup policy, state the exact existing paths or state that will be lost and the available recovery boundary.

A published Git ref may allow a distributed skill or binary to be installed again, but it does not recover local modifications. Treat tracked state as recoverable only when it already exists in Git history, and disclose that private configuration, untracked files, and runtime history may be permanently lost.

Preparing and validating an incoming payload in a temporary location is not a backup and remains required.

## Sanho

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/sanho`

Supported release line: stable `v0.2.9` through `v0.2.x`. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-sanho` skill. v0.2.8 lacks local `sync --inspect`, typed sync and pull refusal details, and the corrected recovery guidance required by Aquarium. Do not automatically cross into `v0.3+`.

Building Sanho v0.2.9 requires Go 1.27 or newer. Check the available toolchain before proposing `go install`. Sanho checks Git's `--no-lazy-fetch` and `show-ref --exists` support when an operation needs those reader controls; report an unsupported capability as an operation failure rather than treating it as empty history or documentation.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/sanho/cmd/sanho@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Diagnose the CLI and workspace with `command -v sanho`, `sanho version --json`, `sanho status --json`, and `sanho doctor --json`; diagnose `use-sanho` independently in the agent skill roots. Read JSON rather than inferring state from human tables or exit status alone. Doctor exits 0 when it reports warnings, so treat a positive `warnings` count as degraded even when the process succeeds. Every malformed `--json` invocation must return the stable `invalid_arguments` error envelope; parse that envelope separately from the process exit and never reinterpret it as workspace state.

Install `use-sanho` from the complete verified `skills/use-sanho/` subtree at the selected release commit, following [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory). Verify `name: use-sanho` and propose the canonical target `use-sanho` under the configured Claude Code skill root. Do not use a fixed file list as the source inventory.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Claude Code so a new session loads the skill snapshot.

`sanho status` separates committed `HEAD` prediction from working-copy and local operation readiness. Consume `relation`, `publication`, `sync_preview`, `working_copy`, `local_readiness`, and `sync_in_progress` independently. Do not expose project URLs, actor email, workspace IDs, private paths, or doctor details in setup reports.

For an active sync or uncertain completion, follow the matching `use-sanho` skill's conditional `sanho sync --inspect --json` guidance. The command gives a bounded local diagnosis; a blocked continuation can exit 0, while `inspection_unavailable` exits 1 without a readiness verdict. Sync and pull refusal envelopes may include stable `reason`, lossless `paths`, and a guidance `recovery_id`. Leave interpretation and recovery to the native skill, and keep commit and push authorization separate from diagnostic evidence.

Use `sanho check --require-clean`, `--require-current`, and `--require-published` only when repository authority selects those policies. Exit 1 with `passed:false` is a policy mismatch; an `error` envelope means evaluation failed. `--require-current` contacts the canonical remote and requires network approval. `sanho diff`, `sanho diff --refresh`, and `sanho diff --local` are read-only inspection commands without JSON output; `--refresh` contacts the canonical remote.

At an authorized push boundary, leave `sanho preview --json` to the matching `use-sanho` skill. Preview writes nothing and reports a blocked push at exit 0, so branch on `blocked` and `verdict`, not the exit code; add `--refresh` only with network authorization when the verdict must match the canonical state the hook will fetch. A preview describes one snapshot and never grants push authority, while `sanho check` remains the explicit policy gate.

Leave canonical history and rewrite-recovery inspection to the matching `use-sanho` skill through read-only `sanho log` and `sanho show <commit>`. Both default to the cached canonical snapshot and `--refresh` requires network authorization. Source filters must use exact non-empty repository or workspace values from observed provenance; an `external` entry has `source: null` and matches no source filter. Use `show` before adopting an external recovery anchor, preserve binary content as classified with null content, and treat `too_large` as a bounded refusal rather than loading the document another way.

Initialization always requires a user-confirmed project name. Inspect `sanho state --all --json` and normalize it without reporting private URLs or paths. A registered v2 project with a non-empty canonical URL may be reused without repeating the URL; an unregistered project still requires a user-confirmed documentation repository URL:

```bash
sanho init --project <project> --docs-repo-url <url>
sanho init --project <registered-project>
```

Before approval, disclose that init can create `.sanho.json` and `.sanho_base.json`, register a private clone, install managed Git hook lines, update ignore state, and conditionally stage documentation state. Inspect custom or Husky hooks and request any required management opt-in rather than forcing initialization. Never guess the project name or URL.

After initialization or upgrade, verify `sanho status --refresh --json`, `sanho doctor --json`, and `git status --short`. Do not run `sanho clean`, `sanho init --force`, `sanho sync --abort`, `sanho migrate`, or any sync/pull operation during setup.

For an explicitly requested repair, load and follow the installed `/use-sanho` lifecycle or recovery guidance when available. `sanho doctor --fix` requires its own repair approval and a fresh status and doctor check afterward. `sanho workspace forget <workspace-id>` requires selecting one exact row from `sanho state --all --json`, proving that its checkout path no longer exists, and separate removal approval. Do not map general setup, cancellation, or cleanup intent to either command.

## Dolgorae

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/dolgorae`

Supported release line: official stable `v0.1.2` through `v0.1.x` for native Apple Silicon macOS. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Reject v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.2 or later, source builds, and development generations.

For an approved installation or update, download the selected tag's official Apple Silicon archive and published `.sha256` file. Verify the checksum before extraction. Extract into ephemeral storage, reject absolute or parent-traversing entries, symlinks, hard links, devices, and unexpected files, and propose one absolute user-owned target, normally `~/.local/bin/dolgorae`. Apply the active backup policy before replacement and never use `sudo` or write a system location.

The v0.1.x distributions are ad-hoc linker-signed, not Developer ID signed or notarized. Disclose that Gatekeeper may require the user to approve the checksum-verified binary locally. Verify the installed target as an executable regular non-symlink arm64 Mach-O file outside Aquarium state roots, and require the exact `{name, version}` JSON from `dolgorae version --json` and a successful closed machine envelope v2 from `dolgorae runtime capabilities`. Capabilities must preserve the v0.1.2 consumer requirements, including machine envelope v2 and advertised machine protocol v1, `home/.dolgorae/controller-carriers`, read-only shared-lane behavior, credential safety, bounded artifacts and interactions, and the required review features. Do not migrate or fall back to v0.1.0 Application Support state.

Dolgorae distributes the optional `use-dolgorae` skill separately from the binary. Diagnose it independently at `use-dolgorae` under the configured Claude Code skill root. Follow [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory) for the entire `skills/use-dolgorae/` subtree at the installed supported release commit, or the selected release when preparing installation. Require `name: use-dolgorae`; the inspector's structural readiness and minimum-file hashes alone do not establish freshness. Never compare against a moving branch or vendor the skill into Aquarium.

After skill installation or replacement approval and the shared backup decision, copy that verified complete tree to the canonical target and compare it again. Preserve local modifications and alternate installations until their exact replacement or migration is approved. Binary readiness and paired-skill readiness remain separate. Repository `dev-setup` checks only canonical skill presence. The `dolgorae` bundle component includes the CLI and paired skill without changing the bundle manifest schema.

Use `/use-dolgorae` for explicitly requested workspace, global Profile, review, engagement, and recovery operations. Global Profile list/show and offline doctor take no workspace scope. A Profile supplies account and launch configuration; doctor compatibility is separate from envelope success. Report `LEGACY_STATE_UNSUPPORTED` through the upstream recovery contract, without automatic migration or initialization. Setup does not create a workspace or Profile, authenticate, start a runtime server, transmit source, or run a review. Dolgorae requires no global MCP registration. A checked attached tool is usable only when the host actually exposes it; do not invoke its hidden adapter from the shell.

For an explicit reusable Specialist request, follow `/use-dolgorae`. No skill in this artifact routes a review through Dolgorae, because `/aquarium:subagent-review` dispatches this host's own subagents instead, so setup reports Dolgorae admission as third-party readiness rather than as a gate on Aquarium review. General Run and Brokered Hierarchy operations still require their own advertised availability; the supported External Specialist facade retains its separate milestone contract.

## Herdr

Herdr is an externally installed native review runtime. Require both its client and server at [v0.9.3](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/releases/tag/v0.9.3) or newer, without an upper version bound, and the installed upstream skill. The [v0.9.3 skill](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/blob/v0.9.3/skills/herdr/SKILL.md) is qualification provenance, not a fixed-version admission requirement. Read the [supervision contract](herdr-supervision.md) for native review and the [migration contract](herdr-migration.md) for preserved legacy state and rollout.

Select this diagnosis only for an explicit Herdr route or readiness request. Check `command -v herdr`, `herdr --version` and the presence of the upstream `herdr` skill under the configured Claude Code skill root independently; this host loads that skill as `/herdr`. Repository setup trusts canonical skill presence; native compatibility and observed host qualification remain separate checks. Before any session inspection or control, require `HERDR_ENV=1` and the actual caller context, then load `/herdr` and use its current help and status surfaces. Inspect client, server and requested reviewer separately. Use Herdr's status and native contract to establish compatibility; unequal client/server versions are eligible when that contract permits. A tool shell's absent context may be an inheritance gap; do not discover another client's focused session.

A readiness gap blocks only the selected Herdr operation. Aquarium setup does not install Herdr, replace its upstream skill, restart its server, remove Orca, or make Herdr a common prerequisite for peer routes. Native host setup needs separate authorization through its upstream owner.

## Mulgae

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/mulgae`

Supported releases: stable `v0.1.25` or newer, native Apple Silicon macOS only. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease release at or above that minimum. SemVer build metadata does not make an otherwise stable release ineligible. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-mulgae` skill. Do not impose an upper version bound or reject a later stable `v0.1.x`, `v0.2+`, or major release solely because its version is newer. Installation requires Go `1.27.1` or newer.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/mulgae@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Repository setup diagnosis uses only `command -v mulgae`, `mulgae version --json`, and `mulgae doctor --output json`, plus effective MCP registration inspection when available. Apply these minimum response contracts to the observed supported version:

| Mulgae | Command envelope | Doctor | Configuration | Provider inventory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable `>=v0.1.25` | `mulgae-command-result.v19` or later | `mulgae-doctor-result.v5` or later | Native supported configuration, Config v5 at the minimum | ZCode, Grok, and Codex at v0.1.25; later canonical families are accepted as reported by the native Doctor contract |

Reject prereleases, versions below the minimum, and responses below a machine-contract floor. Accept later numbered schemas, additive fields, bounded reason codes, and canonical provider family identifiers while continuing to require the baseline typed fields on every reported provider row. Provider membership and order remain native Doctor authority so a later stable release may add, reorder, or retire families without an Aquarium-only version block. If the minimum Doctor contract is absent, report the capability as unsupported; never fabricate failed dimensions or reconstruct them from `.mulgae/config.yaml` or `.mulgae/local.yaml`.

User-global setup intentionally observes only the stable release floor and Apple Silicon platform. Its `version_supported` result does not claim that a repository's command, Doctor, configuration, or review contracts have been verified. Repository setup owns command and Doctor verification after the native configuration pair is available. Review execution separately requires `mulgae-review-preflight.v8` or later through the same-release `/use-mulgae` skill and the shared review contract.

The supported Doctor contract reports `config_v3`, `local_configuration`, `provider_identity`, `configured_readiness`, and `role_route_readiness` independently. The `config_v3` field name remains present in Doctor v5 and does not identify the project's Config version. Preserve each Doctor's `verified`, `failed`, `unverifiable`, and `not_applicable` states and each configured `provider_inventory[]` row's `binary_available`, `cli_compatible`, and `application_compatible` fields. Preserve application compatibility separately because it is independent from CLI or protocol compatibility. Treat an applicable compatibility result as ready only when its `eligibility` is `eligible`; `newer_than_verified` remains ready under that eligibility. Treat setup as configured only when `configured_readiness.state=ready` and `exit_code=0`. Do not gate or report setup on static evidence, heartbeat, historical reviews, or `review_qualified`, and never report native homes, executable paths, credential-profile homes, credentials, diagnostic messages, request IDs, timestamps, or raw provider output.

Setup does not need `mulgae providers --output json`. If that command is explicitly inspected outside the default setup flow, keep `offline_ready_provider_count` and `static_evidence_ready_provider_count` distinct; missing static evidence is not a generic unavailable provider.

Install `use-mulgae` from the complete verified `skills/use-mulgae/` subtree at the selected release commit, following [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory). Verify `name: use-mulgae` and propose the canonical target `use-mulgae` under the configured Claude Code skill root. Do not use a fixed file list as the source inventory.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Claude Code so a new session loads the skill snapshot.

Mulgae configuration has two authorities. `.mulgae/config.yaml` is Git-shareable project policy; `.mulgae/local.yaml` is untracked mode-`0600` machine configuration. Load the installed same-release `/use-mulgae` authoring guidance before proposing configuration. At the v0.1.25 minimum, Config v5 supports ZCode, Grok, and Codex; ZCode requires app version 3.12.3 or newer, Grok requires CLI 1.0.34 or newer, and Codex requires CLI 0.154.0 or newer. Consume the selected Doctor's `cli_compatible` and `application_compatible` results instead of reproducing Mulgae's version decisions. Show discovered executable, app-bundle, launcher, data-home, and credential-home paths only in the exact private setup proposal, never in the diagnostic report.

Before proposing initialization, resolve one effective setup selection: the provider portfolio, enabled roles, provider-specific shared policy, and intended role assignments. A new project with no explicit selection uses ZCode, Grok, and Codex with the six non-UI roles enabled and ZCode as every role's primary provider. Its shared policy pins Grok to `grok-4.7` with `medium` reasoning effort and Codex to `gpt-5.6-sol` with `medium` reasoning effort.

An explicit user selection becomes the effective setup selection. Complete any omitted dimensions through the same-release `/use-mulgae` authoring contract, preserving native provider defaults where the user did not request a pin. Do not add an unselected default provider, role, model, or assignment to that selection.

Resolve the exact machine-local paths for the effective selection before the proposal and carry that same selection through initialization and verification. For the default selection, run the following command with the resolved paths only after approval:

```bash
mulgae init \
  --providers zcode,grok,codex \
  --roles logic,security,maintainability,product,documentation,testing \
  --zcode-app-bundle <canonical-zcode-app-bundle> \
  --grok-executable <canonical-grok-executable> \
  --grok-model grok-4.7 \
  --grok-reasoning-effort medium \
  --codex-executable <canonical-codex-executable> \
  --codex-model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --codex-reasoning-effort medium \
  --output json
```

Mulgae's `auto` selection includes only ZCode and Grok, so it does not satisfy the default selection. Its build-owned role preferences assign the six roles to ZCode when all three families are selected. Verify those assignments from admitted configuration rather than rewriting the generated file. Add `artist` only for an explicitly declared UI project.

ZCode uses the user's v2 Individual Coding Plan state. Config v5 may declare a project model and reasoning effort independently; an omitted value preserves the app-server default for that dimension. Use the same-release authoring guidance for an explicitly selected ZCode policy. Setup must not read or edit ZCode account state, expose selected values, or authenticate the user. Consume only Mulgae's redacted provider identity and readiness results. Explicit ZCode, Grok, and Codex model and reasoning selections remain shared project policy bound through qualification and execution.

After initialization, require verified `config_v3`, `local_configuration`, and `provider_identity` checks plus ready `configured_readiness` and `role_route_readiness` with exit code `0`. Compare the structured initialization result and redacted Doctor output with the effective setup selection. The result's configured provider IDs must match the selected portfolio. Every selected provider row must be configured and eligible, every applicable compatibility result must be eligible, and the provider inventory's role references must match the intended assignments. Every explicitly pinned model or reasoning-effort value must also remain identical in the approved request and returned command envelope.

Do not require an unselected provider or role. For the default selection, these rules require all three providers to be eligible and all six roles to route to ZCode. If any applicable condition fails, a Mulgae-scoped setup is `failed` and an otherwise successful full setup is `partial`; neither may report Mulgae as ready. Preserve any native initialization failure without hand-editing a partial result. Provider CLI installation and authentication remain outside both setup skills.

Initialization creates the selected release's Config pair and does not edit Git ignore state. For an existing valid Config v5 file, derive the effective setup selection from Mulgae's redacted Doctor inventory and role references; do not apply the new-project defaults or read raw configuration during diagnosis, bootstrap, refresh, or unrelated repair. When a clone contains only shared `config.yaml`, plain `mulgae init --output json` bootstraps only `local.yaml` and rejects project-policy options.

When provider paths move or the shared provider set changes, propose `mulgae init --refresh-local --output json`, which preserves `config.yaml` and replaces only `local.yaml`; apply the shared backup policy to the replaced local file. Keep new initialization, clone bootstrap, and refresh as distinct approvals.

Config v1 through v4 are unsupported at the minimum release, which does not migrate them automatically. For an explicitly approved v4 migration, preserve both authorities under the chosen backup policy, set both versions to `5`, and remove shared `execution.workspace_access`; there is no replacement setting. Preserve providers, roles, models and machine paths. Older configurations require their documented provider-path migration first. Do not replace a v4 pair merely to obtain v5. Show the exact legacy files without reading or printing their contents and apply the shared backup policy before any approved replacement or removal. Never migrate configuration merely because setup diagnosis found a release mismatch.

Under the backup policy, separately propose a user-chosen mode-`0700` backup directory outside the repository, preserve both files and their modes with `cp -p`, privately verify file names, modes, and SHA-256 digests, and disclose the exact `cp -p` restoration commands.

Under the no-backup policy, disclose that legacy project policy, private paths, modes, and other local-only values will not be recoverable unless the user independently versioned them. Obtain separate approval for the exact destructive legacy-file removal under either policy.

If initialization fails, preserve the failure and do not partially edit either authority. Offer the disclosed restoration only when a verified backup exists; otherwise report that no rollback copy is available. Never reinterpret legacy provider policy or private paths automatically.

When the user selects Codex, require the minimum for the selected Mulgae release and let Mulgae diagnose its authenticated readiness; never sign in, read `auth.json`, or accept an API-key environment variable on the user's behalf. A single-profile configuration uses the selected Codex CLI's native login with `mulgae init --providers codex --roles <roles> --output json`. Optional model and reasoning-effort values are shared project policy; omission preserves Codex CLI defaults.

For several Codex identities, keep the two authorities separate using the selected release's native configuration shape; it is sufficient for the active setup session even when a newly replaced `/use-mulgae` skill will not load until Claude Code restarts:

```yaml
# .mulgae/config.yaml project policy (relevant fields)
providers:
  codex:
    default_credential_profile: "personal"
roles:
  logic: {enabled: true, primary_provider: "codex"}
  security: {enabled: true, primary_provider: "codex", credential_profile: "work"}
```

```yaml
# .mulgae/local.yaml private machine mapping (relevant fields)
providers:
  codex:
    executable: "/absolute/path/to/the/common/codex"
    credential_homes:
      - profile: "personal"
        home: "/absolute/private/CODEX_HOME"
      - profile: "work"
        home: "/absolute/private/work-CODEX_HOME"
```

Use operator-chosen lowercase kebab-case aliases, map exactly the default and role override aliases in lexical order, and use one common real Codex executable. Obtain separate approval for the shared policy and private local mapping, show the exact proposed YAML privately, and preserve unrelated fields in the selected Config version. Mulgae may project only the selected home's `auth.json` into a disposable runtime; do not expose profile paths or credential material. After writing, require the selected Doctor contract to verify provider identity, report the intended role-to-profile aliases through redacted role references, and mark Codex binary and CLI compatibility ready without returning any home or executable path.

Review execution, extraction, and provider-free publication reconciliation belong to the paired `/use-mulgae` skill. [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md) defines how Aquarium consumes published reports and structured findings; setup does not run or inspect extraction artifacts.

Repository setup verification remains limited to version, the minimum command and Doctor contracts, and effective MCP registration. Do not infer new setup probes from extraction, recovery, runtime diagnostics, or lifecycle support. Doctor's adapter-owned local version command is offline: it uses no credential projection, project working directory, provider API, or network request. Do not inspect config contents or runs, and do not invoke heartbeat, qualification, preflight, review, source transmission, or MCP startup to validate setup.

Heartbeat is outside setup. Only after a separate explicit user request acknowledging possible authentication, network access, cost, and remote logging may an agent propose `mulgae heartbeat --provider <family> --authorize-live-request --output json`, adding `--credential-profile <profile>` only for an explicitly selected named Codex configuration. Never add `--authorize-live-request` automatically. Require `mulgae-provider-heartbeat-result.v3` or later and preserve its typed outcome without retry. Do not promote success into offline readiness or review qualification. Without authorization, preserve Mulgae's `attempted=false` and `live_authorization_required` result.

Propose these root-anchored Git ignore rules through an exact reviewed diff:

```gitignore
/.mulgae/*
!/.mulgae/config.yaml
```

Verify that only `.mulgae/config.yaml` is trackable and that `.mulgae/local.yaml` and all runtime state remain untracked and ignored. Do not generate or propose `.mulgaeignore`: v0.1.25 neither generates nor processes it. Leave existing user files untouched and reassess paths previously excluded by them before an authorized review. Git ignore rules select workspace candidates, include tracked files even when patterns match, and do not deny provider reads. Source selection and read access follow the same-release native contract.

Treat MCP as an optional, separately approved component and prefer one user-global registration. Register it with `claude mcp add -s user mulgae -- <absolute-selected-mulgae-path> mcp`, which writes `mcpServers` in the user configuration (`~/.claude.json`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when that variable is set). A user-scoped server is available in every project and inherits each session's own working directory, so omit `--project-root` and pin no repository path. The user configuration is machine state; it is never staged or committed.

When the user explicitly chooses repository-local scope, merge this machine-specific alternative into `<absolute-git-root>/.mcp.json` while preserving unrelated configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mulgae": {
      "command": "<absolute-selected-mulgae-path>",
      "args": ["mcp", "--project-root", "<absolute-git-root>"]
    }
  }
}
```

A project-scoped stdio entry supports `command`, `args`, and `env` only. Bind the canonical repository through the explicit `--project-root` argument rather than a working directory, and treat startup and tool timeouts as host settings rather than registration facts in either scope. Never invent unsupported keys to mirror another host's registration shape. Mulgae admits a two-hour review deadline plus retry and finalization margin, so the host tool deadline must cover at least 7501 seconds; preserve any larger existing value.

`.mcp.json` is shared project configuration that each collaborator approves before the host connects to it, and an absolute binary path inside a tracked copy is machine-specific. Show the complete diff and target scope before approval; for a local target also show whether `.mcp.json` is tracked. Verify three views independently without starting the server: read the user-global registration from the user configuration's `mcpServers`, read the local registration from `<absolute-git-root>/.mcp.json`, and derive the effective registration from the documented precedence, in which a private per-project entry in the user configuration shadows `.mcp.json`, which shadows the user-global entry. Treat a named server as absent only when none of those sources names it. An unreadable or malformed source is degraded or unverifiable, never proof of absence.

The effective entry must be stdio and resolve to the selected binary. Global scope requires exact `args = ["mcp"]` and no repository binding; local scope requires exact `mcp --project-root <canonical-root>` arguments. Record the Claude Code version separately. `claude mcp get mulgae` is an optional cross-check: its `Scope:` line names the scope the host actually resolved and wins when it disagrees with the derived view, its output is human-readable rather than typed, so record only what it states, and because it health-checks an approved server it may start the process, so disclose that before running it during setup. A `.mcp.json` server still shown as `⏸ Pending approval` is unverified, not a mismatch.

Whenever a local Mulgae registration exists, an explicit bundle `local_mcp` selection confirms local scope; preserve it without asking again. If the bundle requests no Mulgae MCP, preserve the registration without proposing cleanup. For ordinary setup or an explicit global request, ask whether local scope is intentional. If confirmed, preserve it; an explicit global request then remains a scope mismatch. If not, show and separately approve removal of only the local `mulgae` entry, using `claude mcp remove mulgae -s project` or an equivalent exact JSON edit. Reinspect the file afterward. Delete `.mcp.json` only when it has no remaining `mcpServers` entries and no other keys; preserve every unrelated entry. Apply the shared backup policy before removal, never remove the user-global registration as part of local cleanup, and never stage the file during setup. A same-name project entry shadows the user-global one for that repository, so do not create one as part of global setup. Repository configuration paths must be regular non-symlink paths before `mulgae doctor` or any owning CLI probe may read them.

Tell the user to restart Claude Code after registration changes. Registration does not prove that the current session exposes the selected release's tools, including `start_review`, `await_review` and `inspect_review`. Use already-exposed tool metadata when available without starting another server. The paired `/use-mulgae` skill owns asynchronous execution and native fallback; Aquarium consumes results through [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md).

Verify configuration, provider readiness, skill files, and MCP registration only. Do not start the MCP server or run heartbeat, review, qualification, preflight, publication reconciliation, report, export, or any command that captures, transmits, or writes review source or artifacts during setup. Mulgae owns its same-provider retry. Setup never starts recovery work; authorized review recovery follows [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md) and the paired skill.

## Gaori

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/gaori`

Supported release line: stable `v0.1.18` through `v0.1.x`. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-gaori` and `use-gaori-status` skills. Do not automatically cross into `v0.2+`. CLI JSON reports exactly `name` and a `v`-prefixed `version`; it no longer carries source commit identity. MCP `serverInfo.version` uses the internal version representation. Verify each transport independently: a CLI on PATH does not prove the attached server version, and a missing CLI does not disable connected MCP execution. If host initialization metadata is unavailable, report the MCP version as unverified and follow the requesting repository's pinned-tool policy.

Building Gaori v0.1.18 from source requires Go 1.27.1 or newer. Check the available toolchain before proposing `go install`.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/gaori@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Diagnose the CLI and repository with `command -v gaori`, `gaori version --json`, and, when `.gaori/tester.yaml` exists, `gaori --json config check`. Diagnose `use-gaori`, `use-gaori-status`, and global, local, and effective MCP registration independently. Config check validates schema-v2 config and all stored rules without resolving executables, running commands, or creating evidence.

Install `use-gaori` from the complete verified `skills/use-gaori/` subtree at the selected release commit, following [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory). Verify `name: use-gaori` and propose the canonical target `use-gaori` under the configured Claude Code skill root. Do not use a fixed file list as the source inventory.

For `use-gaori-status`, inventory the entire `skills/use-gaori-status/` subtree at the same commit and require `name: use-gaori-status`. Apply the same complete-tree comparison, duplicate, backup, approval, and restart rules to its target `use-gaori-status` under the configured Claude Code skill root. A selected Gaori component diagnoses both skills, but a missing status skill does not degrade CLI, execution-skill, or MCP health.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Claude Code if the skill does not appear in the active session.

Discover required checks from repository instructions, task runners, manifests, and CI before proposing `.gaori/tester.yaml` schema version 2. Map each configured command ID to an existing argv array, non-empty tags, explicit parser, and timeout. Use `gaori --json parsers list` as the authoritative live registry before selecting a parser. Use `gaori --json parsers catalog` (`gaori-parser-catalog.v1`) for each label's code-owned support tier and output family. `dart-test`, `patrol`, `dotnet-test` and `gradle-test` are Experimental; their bounded summaries may require manual confirmation. Use `gaori --json parsers detect <raw-log>` only to diagnose an explicitly selected existing log: it reports candidates without selecting a parser, loading configuration, creating evidence, or changing the command result. Do not add secrets, absolute paths, or machine-specific arguments to portable configuration.

Gaori is an optional execution and evidence-compression wrapper; it does not create a new test gate, change command authorization, override the child process exit status, or grant acceptance. Keep runtime state local while allowing Git to track portable config and reviewed active rules. Replace a blanket `.gaori/` ignore entry only through an approved exact diff:

```gitignore
.gaori/*
!.gaori/tester.yaml
!.gaori/tester/
.gaori/tester/*
!.gaori/tester/rules/
.gaori/tester/rules/*
!.gaori/tester/rules/*.yaml
```

This keeps `.gaori/toolchain.yaml`, `.gaori/rule-proposals/`, `.gaori/runs/`, and every other Gaori path local. Active rule YAML is executable extraction policy: do not create, update, stage, or commit it without the user's specific intent and review. Validate approved config or rule changes with `gaori --json config check`. When approved redaction patterns change and the user has explicitly selected an existing raw log no larger than 256 KiB, use `gaori --json config check --sample <raw-log>` to report ordered match and replaced-byte counts without emitting matched text or pattern definitions. Do not run configured tests during setup.

Leave completed evidence and proposal reconciliation to the matching `use-gaori` skill. Its `gaori --json runs list`, `gaori --json rules proposals`, and `gaori rules show --proposal <name>` paths are read-only discovery, not repair, activation, command reruns, or durable job recovery. Never inspect prior run contents or raw logs automatically during setup.

Treat MCP as an optional, separately approved component and prefer one user-global registration. Register it with `claude mcp add -s user gaori -- <absolute-selected-gaori-path> mcp`, which writes `mcpServers` in the user configuration. A user-scoped server inherits each session's own working directory, so omit `--repo` and pin no repository path. The user configuration is machine state; it is never staged or committed.

When the user explicitly chooses repository-local scope, merge this machine-specific alternative into `<absolute-git-root>/.mcp.json` while preserving unrelated configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gaori": {
      "command": "<absolute-selected-gaori-path>",
      "args": ["--repo", "<absolute-git-root>", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Show the complete diff and target scope before approval; for a local target also show whether `.mcp.json` is tracked. Never stage it during setup. Verify user-global, local, and effective registrations with the same three-view procedure used for Mulgae. Global scope requires exact `args = ["mcp"]` and no repository binding; local scope requires exact `--repo <canonical-root> mcp` arguments. Do not start the server or a test. Registration inspection covers configuration only. At execution time, `/use-gaori` verifies the attached server's launch repository, environment, and overrides. The native paired skill recommends a host timeout of 3600 seconds or greater; execution eligibility depends on the selected command duration plus evidence finalization. On this host that deadline is a host setting rather than a registration property: preserve valid existing settings, never invent a timeout key, and report an unobserved deadline as unknown rather than as a setup failure. Neither a configured nor an unknown deadline proves that a particular command can finish before it. Let `/use-gaori` select the supported waiting transport from actual command and host evidence; never impose an Aquarium timeout floor or edit host configuration to manufacture eligibility. Report disabled, non-stdio, unresolvable-command, wrong-repository, and pending-approval entries as degraded or unverified. Treat a named server as absent only when none of the three sources names it.

Whenever a local Gaori registration exists, an explicit bundle `local_mcp` selection confirms local scope; preserve it without asking again. If the bundle requests no Gaori MCP, preserve the registration without proposing cleanup. For ordinary setup or an explicit global request, ask whether local scope is intentional. If confirmed, preserve it; an explicit global request then remains a scope mismatch. If not, show and separately approve removal of only the local `gaori` entry, using `claude mcp remove gaori -s project` or an equivalent exact JSON edit. Apply the same backup, empty-file, unrelated-entry preservation, and no-staging rules as Mulgae local cleanup. Never remove the user-global registration as part of local cleanup.

Tell the user to restart Claude Code after registration changes. Verify connected capabilities from already-exposed tool metadata when available; neither registration nor a PATH CLI proves the active MCP surface. `/use-gaori` owns asynchronous execution and native fallback. [gaori-integration.md](gaori-integration.md) owns Aquarium's command and evidence handoff.

Diagnose the optional `/use-gaori-status` skill independently. It owns historical statistics and detailed timing explanations; its absence does not block execution or a live estimate supported by `/use-gaori`. Setup never queries run history or estimates automatically.

Every present repository configuration path that Gaori may inspect, including `.gaori/tester.yaml`, every descendant of `.gaori/tester/rules/`, and `.gaori/toolchain.yaml`, must have regular non-symlink lexical ancestry before any owning CLI probe may read it; an absent primary path stops that probe rather than consulting ambient state.

## Sorage

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/sorage`

Supported release line: stable `v0.1.2` through `v0.1.x`, native Apple Silicon macOS only. Sorage v0.1.2 adds Project Memos and changes the Project and storage contracts. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in the supported range and use the same exact tag for the CLI and `use-sorage` skill. Do not automatically cross into `v0.2+`.

The official release provides `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64`, `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64.sha256`, and `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64.manifest.json`. Before installation, verify the checksum file, require the manifest's version, target, binary name, digest, and revision to match the selected tag, asset, and peeled tag commit, and run `codesign --verify --strict` against the binary. Disclose that the release is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Install the separately approved regular executable to the exact user-owned target, normally `~/.local/bin/sorage`, without `sudo`; the packaged binary needs no Bun runtime. Verify the installed target with `sorage version --json`.

The binary does not install the agent skill. Install the complete verified `skills/use-sorage/` subtree at the selected release commit, following [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory). Require `name: use-sorage` and propose `use-sorage` under the configured Claude Code skill root. Existing targets follow the shared comparison, backup, replacement-approval, and restart rules. The release-matched skill owns explicit Memo operations, including version-fenced updates and replay-only recovery of uncertain writes.

Treat missing, extra, modified, duplicate, or symlinked content as a separate skill gap. Show the complete diff and follow the shared backup and approval rules before installing or replacing it. Tell the user to restart Claude Code if the current session does not expose the newly installed skill.

Repository inspection diagnoses the supported CLI with the explicit `--include-sorage` path, which runs `sorage version --json`, `sorage doctor --json`, and, only when doctor has no blocking check, Project resolution. Global inspection always checks the version and uses `--include-sorage-initialization` to add only the doctor path. The version command returns the bare `{name, version}` object; doctor returns a versioned Sorage envelope. Accept doctor state only when all 20 v0.1 catalog IDs appear once in their specified order with valid fields and `ok`, `warning`, or `blocking` severity. Doctor exits `0` when no check is blocking and `1` when any check is blocking. The all-blocking catalog with `sorage init` recovery identifies an uninitialized installation. Any partial, reordered, or otherwise invalid catalog is unverifiable.

These commands make no network request. Doctor opens the local database for some checks, and Project resolution uses Sorage's native open-and-migrate path. Selected diagnosis may therefore update the database or journal. Start with version-only inventory.

A confirmed fresh installation has no old database to migrate. Before v0.1.2 opens an existing pre-Memo installation, follow the [upstream upgrade and rollback procedure](https://github.com/irootkernel/sorage/blob/v0.1.2/docs/ops/README.md#memo-storage-upgrade-and-rollback). Stop old CLI writers, the daemon, and backup jobs. Use the old binary to produce and verify a format-1 backup, retain a separate Vault copy, and prove restore in an empty installation. Keep old writers stopped and replace the CLI only after that preparation. Never run the old binary against the upgraded database.

Before doctor, both inspectors read the schema under the selected `SORAGE_HOME` or `~/.sorage` through a read-only handle. A missing home or empty home is fresh. A missing database in a nonempty home returns `installation_recovery_required`, including when WAL or SHM remains. For a pre-Memo database, they check the Installation ID in `config.yaml` against a valid Vault marker and any database Installation row or Project bindings, then run native `sorage config validate --json` without opening the database. A missing, malformed, or mismatched configuration or Vault marker returns `installation_recovery_required`. Preserve these installations for native recovery instead of initializing a new identity. An unreadable or inconsistent database, unavailable YAML parser, or unavailable validation probe returns `upgrade_state_unverifiable`. Neither state admits doctor, even with a preflight confirmation flag. An existing pre-Memo database with matching identity and valid configuration returns `upgrade_preflight_required` until its backup and restore drill are confirmed. Passing `--sorage-upgrade-preflight-complete` with the include flag then returns `upgrade_migration_required`; it does not run doctor or migrate the database.

After the preflight, separately propose and obtain approval for `sorage init --reconfigure --non-interactive --json` with the selected v0.1.2 executable and exact installation home. Immediately before running it, confirm that the home still has the same configuration, Installation ID, Vault marker, and database identity. This native operation migrates the database and can backfill missing token or Vault state. Keep old writers stopped, verify the migration outcome, and rerun the inspector. Doctor runs only for a fresh home or a database that already records the Project Memo migration; repository Project resolution follows only when doctor has no blocking check. Disclose the native database and journal effects before diagnosis. Without the include flag, inventory checks only version and platform: a supported CLI reports `not_inspected`, while an unsupported version or platform reports `degraded`.

Summarize only check counts by `ok`, `warning`, and `blocking`. Never copy check messages, request IDs, Installation IDs, Vault paths, database paths, tokens, or other private state into the setup report. A warning does not block the minimal local profile, while any blocking check prevents readiness.

When Sorage is not initialized, separately propose this minimal profile:

```bash
sorage init --non-interactive --json
```

Show the exact effective `SORAGE_HOME` and default Vault paths before approval. This command creates the home tree, config, database, API token, and managed Vault, but does not start the daemon, install a LaunchAgent, initialize Vault Git, enable backup, or configure push. Preserve an existing valid installation. Treat `--reconfigure`, daemon or service setup, Vault movement, backup, restore, and uninstall as distinct native Sorage operations with their own exact proposals; never edit the managed Vault directly.

After initialization, run `sorage project resolve --path <canonical-git-root> --json`. Read no inbox, outbox, Handoff title, Review Note, or Artifact during setup. Readiness requires an active Project whose selected binding kind is `git_repository`; a containing `directory` binding does not register the repository itself.

If resolution returns a registered Project through a containing `directory` binding, report a non-ready binding-kind gap and preserve the existing binding. Stop automatic setup for that repository, require a separate explicit native repair decision, and do not propose `project add` or `project bind` from that result.

Treat only a successful `unregistered_workspace` result as `registration_required`. Unless Master explicitly requested Project setup, report that status and stop before listing Projects or preparing a registration proposal. For explicitly requested setup, disclose that `sorage project list --json` opens the same local database and may apply native migrations, then obtain separate explicit approval before running it. Only after that approved listing may you ask whether to create a new Project or bind an existing active one. A native resolution error is `resolution_error`. Preserve its symbolic code, leave Project registration unverifiable, and do not propose `project add` or `project bind`.

Require an exact user-confirmed display name and immutable slug for creation:

```bash
sorage project add --name <name> --slug <slug> --dir <canonical-git-root> --json
sorage project bind <existing-active-slug> --dir <canonical-git-root> --json
```

Do not guess Project identity, use `--allow-unregistered`, or silently unarchive a Project. An archived Project requires a separately approved `sorage project unarchive <slug> --json`; archive and unarchive use the implicit User actor in v0.1.2. For an explicitly requested replacement of an existing binding, inspect its recorded path and propose `sorage project rebind <slug> --from <recorded-path> --to <existing-path> --json` under the same exact-target approval boundary. Do not rebind merely because a containing directory resolves. On `AMBIGUOUS_PROJECT`, `BINDING_DUPLICATE`, `PROJECT_SLUG_CONFLICT`, `VAULT_CONTAINMENT`, or another native error, preserve state and return its symbolic code. Re-resolve the exact Git root after mutation and require the active `git_repository` result before reporting registration complete.

Require the whole `.sorage/` directory to be ignored by the repository root `.gitignore`, with no tracked descendant and no symlinked `.sorage/` path. Preserve existing content and an equivalent rule without duplication. If `.gitignore` is absent, propose creating it; if only another exclude source ignores `.sorage/`, report the repository-policy gap and propose the root `.gitignore` addition. Show the complete diff and obtain separate approval before either change. If any `.sorage/` path is already tracked, report the conflict and stop rather than editing, deleting, or untracking it. The Sorage CLI never edits Git ignore files.

A healthy supported CLI remains `installed` when initialization, registration, Project state, binding kind, skill, ignore, tracking, or symlink readiness is incomplete. Use `degraded` for an unhealthy runtime, invalid command contract, or blocking doctor result other than the exact uninitialized catalog. Report that catalog as `installed` with `readiness_status: initialization_required`, and use `configured` only for complete readiness. `/aquarium:dev-setup` owns explicitly requested Project setup, including identity confirmation, approval, and fresh resolution. It also owns separately approved root `.gitignore` preparation whenever Sorage readiness is diagnosed. An effective per-target `sorage` selection in an explicitly supplied `dev-setup-bundle` manifest counts as a Project setup request for that target, but does not authorize Project listing or mutation without the separately required approvals.

For an explicit broker operation, load the same-release `/use-sorage` skill with a supported CLI. Current repository setup readiness is not a prerequisite. Check only the requested inbox or outbox and report its result without starting another operation. Route explicit Memo reads and writes through that skill. Memo add or list uses native current-directory resolution only when no Project or all-project scope was selected; explicit Project selectors and Memo IDs need no current-directory binding. Memo text grants no execution authority, and closing a Memo proves no roadmap or tool lifecycle completion. Within requested Handoff processing, that skill owns the Review Note read before sender revision and any optional bounded event timeline read, together with every fetch, review, revision, acceptance, retention, deletion, backup, and Vault operation. Report `SENDER_IDENTITY_DOWNGRADE` without automatically using `--allow-unregistered`.

## Lora / Lore

Official source: `https://github.com/tmdgusya/lora`

Lora distributes agent skills rather than a runtime service. Configure it for the Claude Code user-global scope. Resolve the latest stable tag when one exists; otherwise resolve the full current `main` commit SHA and disclose that fallback before approval. Prepare a temporary detached checkout at the approved commit and install from that local source; verify the detached HEAD before invoking the pinned installer.

Install only the two compatible skills from the approved ref:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/tmdgusya/lora <temporary-source-root>/lora
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora fetch --depth=1 origin <approved-tag-or-full-sha>
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora rev-parse HEAD
npx skills@<approved-installer-version> add <temporary-source-root>/lora \
  --skill lore-commits \
  --skill lore-query \
  --global \
  --agent claude-code \
  --copy \
  --yes
```

The clone and fetch contact GitHub, and `npx` contacts npm and writes `lore-commits` and `lore-query` to `~/.claude/skills/lore-commits` and `~/.claude/skills/lore-query`. Require the detached `HEAD` to equal the approved ref before installation. Do not install or invoke Lora's `lore-setup`; it copies the full Lore protocol into AGENTS.md and conflicts with the reference-and-override policy. If `lore-setup` is already installed, report it without removing or rewriting it.

Before updating an existing `lore-commits` or `lore-query`, compare its complete installed file set with the approved source, show the target and diff, and apply the shared backup policy before the approved `npx skills@<approved-installer-version> add` action. Under the no-backup policy, disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the source ref. After installation, enumerate both complete source and target trees, reject missing and extra paths, and compare every regular file byte-for-byte; any symlink or digest mismatch fails verification. The bundled inspector reports only structural presence and frontmatter as `unverifiable`, never complete-source currency. Do not report configured until this post-action complete-tree comparison passes. Do not treat installation as commit authority.

## Cursor Team Kit / Deslop

Official source: `https://github.com/cursor/plugins`

Deslop is a separately installed upstream prerequisite, not an Aquarium skill. This integration has no supported skill-specific release line, so resolve and disclose the full current `main` commit SHA through official GitHub commit metadata, then prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact commit. Never install from a moving `main`; use the verified detached checkout with the pinned installer.

Install only the upstream Deslop skill from the approved checkout and preserve its parent plugin's MIT notice:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/cursor/plugins <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins fetch --depth=1 origin <approved-full-sha>
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins rev-parse HEAD
npx skills@<approved-installer-version> add <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins/cursor-team-kit \
  --skill deslop \
  --global \
  --agent claude-code \
  --copy \
  --yes
install -m 0644 <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins/cursor-team-kit/LICENSE ~/.claude/skills/deslop/LICENSE
```

The clone and fetch contact GitHub, and `npx` contacts npm and writes `~/.claude/skills/deslop`. Show every endpoint, command, approved SHA, target, source digest, and expected file before installation approval. Verify that the installed `SKILL.md` and LICENSE are byte-identical to the detached checkout, the frontmatter is exactly `name: deslop`, the target contains no extra files, and no duplicate or symlink installation exists in another agent skill root.

If the target exists, compare its complete tree with the approved source plus LICENSE, show the complete diff, apply the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Never merge an Aquarium variant or local customization into the upstream payload. After installation or replacement, clean up the ephemeral checkout when possible and tell the user to restart Claude Code before resuming the requesting Aquarium workflow.

## Humanizer

Official source: `https://github.com/blader/humanizer`

Support stable releases `>=v2.11.1` without an upper bound. Resolve the latest stable release by default or the user's selected supported release through official GitHub release metadata. Prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact tag and require `HEAD` to equal the resolved release commit. Require a regular non-symlink root `SKILL.md` and `LICENSE`, `name: humanizer`, and a frontmatter version matching the selected tag. Include any additional regular skill files required by that release's upstream guidance in the verified install payload.

Install the verified payload at `humanizer` under the configured Claude Code skill root — `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` when that variable is set, otherwise `~/.claude/skills`, only after separate approval. Compare the complete selected payload and target trees and every digest, rejecting missing or extra paths, symlinks, invalid frontmatter, a below-minimum or mismatched version, and copies that would be loaded beside the selected target. Never execute Humanizer or rewrite prose during setup.

## im-not-ai

Official source: `https://github.com/epoko77-ai/im-not-ai`

Support stable releases `>=v2.3.2` without an upper bound. Resolve the latest stable release by default or the user's selected supported release through official GitHub release metadata, prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact tag, and require `HEAD` to equal the resolved release commit. Read the checked-out `install.sh` and require every write target to derive from an isolated temporary `CLAUDE_HOME`. Disclose the exact `./install.sh --claude-only --copy` command and temporary target and obtain separate approval for that upstream-code execution, then run it without `--force`. Reject unexpected writes outside that isolated directory, then add the checkout's root LICENSE to the generated payload.

The installer builds this host's payload from its own `skills/` tree rather than the one its other host mode materializes, so a payload generated for that host is not this one's content. Require the materialized payload to contain only regular non-symlink files, the exact generated tree, and `name: humanize-korean`. At the v2.3.2 minimum it is three skills — `humanize-korean`, `humanize`, and `humanize-redo` — plus the four subagents the installer selects without `--all-agents`. Install that complete payload at `<skill-name>` under the configured Claude Code skill root and `<agent>.md` under the matching `agents/` directory, only after separate approval. Compare every path and digest after installation. Report copies that would be loaded beside the selected target as duplicates, and migrate or remove one only with separate approval and the shared backup policy. Never point the active skill target at a checkout, run the installer against the active `~/.claude`, invoke the skill, or create `_workspace/` during setup.

## Podway

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/podway`

Support stable releases `>=v0.2.14` without a version upper bound, on native Apple Silicon macOS. Resolve the latest non-draft, non-prerelease official release by default or the user's selected supported release. Version eligibility is separate from machine-contract compatibility. Require Output v4, Error v2, version-result v2, contract-manifest v2, and observation/status v5 where consumed. Report an actual contract mismatch rather than rejecting a later major or minor version by number.

Pin the optional `use-podway` skill independently to the v0.2.14 release commit `fa29dba929777b020377bc9803cb0a3954d219b1`. Follow [Complete Paired-Skill Inventory](#complete-paired-skill-inventory) for every regular file in `skills/use-podway/`, including its lifecycle, goal, recovery and delegation references. Require `name: use-podway` at the approved `use-podway` target under the configured Claude Code skill root. Later runtime releases do not change this pin automatically. Keep `create-podway-procedure` as a separate maintainer dependency; setup neither installs nor requires it. Aquarium does not vendor either tree.

Download the selected Apple Silicon archive, its published checksum and provenance only within the approved preparation scope. Verify the checksum, archive members, release commit and target before proposing installation of the single `bin/podway` executable at the exact user-local path. Disclose that the artifact is unsigned and not notarized. Binary installation, paired-skill replacement, legacy service retirement and workspace reset are distinct effects. Compare the complete verified skill tree with existing targets, show replacement diffs, preserve customizations, and follow the shared approval and backup policy.

For global diagnosis, use the compact `podway version --json` and `podway --json version --identity` from a neutral directory. Validate the latter's Output v4, version-result v2, Apple Silicon target, build/source identity and contract-manifest v2 digest. No workspace or service inspection is needed for global CLI readiness. A missing or below-minimum CLI needs global setup. No daemon, account runtime, socket, named runtime mode or readiness wait participates in the current path.

For routine managed-session admission, use `podway --json observe` in the owning worktree. Require Output v4 with observation-result v5, or Error v2 `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` for no current session. Check version identity, tracked configuration, native Procedure checks, handler compatibility and workspace health separately under [Podway Integration Contract](podway-integration.md#check-readiness-on-the-default-path). Status and compact status use v5 for both direct and delegated Procedures. A prepared, running or undisposed terminal session is a lifecycle matter, not setup repair authority.

Preserve all five same-ID custom Procedures. Report source provenance as `canonical`, `valid_customization`, `invalid`, `missing`, `unsafe` or `unverifiable`, and handler compatibility independently as `compatible`, `unqualified`, `incompatible` or `not_checked`. All absent means aggregate `readiness_status=not_configured`; complete-library readiness requires tracked regular non-symlink configuration and five native-valid, handler-compatible files plus healthy compatible runtime. Selected route membership is checked from exact source bytes after the selected source checks, independently of provider availability and an admitted immutable snapshot. Recognized prior-canonical bytes explain an offered update but never authorize replacement. Source changes apply to successor sessions. Protected released managed copies, adopted repository customization, ignored local adopted bundles and optional reusable sources have distinct roles. Retained history and optional library entries are not adopted workflow policy merely because they exist. Specific post-use preservation consent may authorize new reusable sources; it never authorizes overwriting managed canonical copies or changing a running snapshot.

The explicit selected-admission inspector separates `runtime_readiness` and the selected source/binding/route from aggregate `readiness_status`. It accepts a compatible native session tuple without the managed five-ID, filename or tracking rules. Missing unrelated templates can degrade the library while the selected definition remains compatible. Keep current lifecycle/tuple, session conflicts, same-family adopted-customization obligations and native failure codes visible. An optional historical local bundle contributes diagnostics, not a startup prerequisite. The selected inspector exposes them under `selected_procedure.retention.diagnostics`, with alias and key-association limits. Prepared and running adopted sessions resolve by native tuple; missing or damaged selected material stops before begin/work with no legacy fallback. Existing canonical/custom/formal paths retain their own contracts.

This path uses the [adaptive launcher](../shared/manage_adaptive_procedure.py) with an available supported Python interpreter, YAML and `jsonschema`. It reports missing prerequisites explicitly and does no installation. Ordinary inspector invocations do not import adaptive dependencies. Runtime/setup environment guidance selects an existing compatible installed interpreter explicitly; target repositories must not assume Aquarium's development `.venv` exists. Confirm that the selected interpreter imports YAML and `jsonschema` before using the launcher. An already installed isolated tool environment may supply them. Missing imports remain `missing-prerequisite`; repository setup does not install dependencies as a side effect. Aquarium currently has no global installer component that provisions a combined YAML and `jsonschema` environment. If no compatible interpreter can import both, report the diagnosed/manual prerequisite gap; any environment provisioning needs its own exact supported proposal and authority. All five families now use qualified selected-source admission; setup inspection itself neither starts sessions nor grants execution authority.

Tracked or untracked `root-kernel-*-v2.yaml` files retain their separately diagnosed product-rename migration. Preserve existing sessions and custom sources before an approved managed update. Never create an ownership manifest or a second source of Procedure authority.

### Initialize and install managed Procedures

For an approved repository initialization, run `podway --json init --idempotency-key <new-key>` in the exact worktree. Disclose its tracked `.podway/config.yaml` and `.podway/.gitignore` files and ignored `.podway/runtime/` state before writing. Install missing or explicitly selected bundled Procedure sources into `.podway/procedures/` byte-for-byte. Check regular files and every path component for symlinks before reading, hashing or invoking them; an unsafe managed path remains degraded and is never executed.

Validate every selected file with the supported CLI:

```bash
podway --json procedure check --warnings-as-errors <procedure-file>
podway --json procedure preview <procedure-file>
```

Task, Goal, Validation, Design and Diagnosis handlers use [adaptive selected admission](adaptive-execution.md) for the actual source and route, independently of aggregate library completeness. The following filename/ID inventory remains the ordinary managed-library diagnostic and legacy/setup contract.

Match each filename to preview's `procedure_id`. The required IDs are `aquarium-task-v2`, `aquarium-goal-v2`, `aquarium-validation-v2`, `aquarium-design-v2` and `aquarium-war-room-v2`. Their presence establishes readiness, not workflow activation. Native validity and handler compatibility remain separate checks. The setup inspector needs PyYAML to qualify declared review routes even when a prior-canonical digest establishes general handler compatibility.

For a customization, show the exact current-to-canonical diff and handler-contract result, then preserve it or apply only its approved replacement. Preservation writes nothing; an incompatible customization remains degraded. Replacement follows the chosen backup policy and rechecks the exact target bytes. A broader setup approval never authorizes merging, normalizing or overwriting customized files, and an active session keeps its immutable snapshot.

### Upgrade from older writers

Podway v0.2.13 replaced the daemon contract with Direct execution and SQLite generation 15. v0.2.14 also changes the writer manifest and declares no v0.2.13 predecessor. Legacy generations are refused unchanged with `LEGACY_RUNTIME_STATE_UNSUPPORTED`; incompatible direct writers use `WORKSPACE_CONTRACT_MISMATCH`. Preserve those errors and state. Semver alone never grants Store migration. Diagnose writer identity through `version --json --identity` and follow the selected release's native recovery contract.

A legacy non-production `mode` in tracked configuration produces `WORKSPACE_CONFIG_INVALID` before Store admission. This error carries no specific cause and does not itself authorize reset. Through `/aquarium:dev-setup`, inspect the tracked `.podway/config.yaml` and establish a retired mode only when its `podway.workspace/v2` configuration declares `mode` other than `prod`. Otherwise keep readiness degraded and do not propose a runtime reset from this error. For an established retired mode, disclose and separately approve the exact tracked configuration correction before any approved runtime discard. The reset preserves the corrected configuration; it cannot repair the retired mode by itself.

Finish or explicitly abandon old sessions using their exact original writer before replacing it. For daemon-era installations, use that original release's supported service retirement under separate authority; the new CLI cannot retire the old service. Installing the new CLI or resetting a workspace does not authorize removing legacy `~/.podway` account state.

To discard incompatible runtime history, first identify the exact worktree, establish that no other writer uses it, and obtain explicit approval for loss of every current/inactive session and all runtime history. Native reset makes no backup or conversion. Any separately selected history-preservation preparation must occur before discard. For diagnosed discard-eligible older or mismatched state, the new writer uses:

```bash
podway --worktree <absolute-root> --json reset --all --yes --idempotency-key <new-key>
```

This is a new unfenced discard request, not a weakened retry. A UUID-fenced reset cannot reopen the incompatible Store. The command creates a fresh UUID and current Store while preserving configuration, Procedures, ignore rules and unrelated worktree files. Preserve its original request/key after interruption and use native marker recovery; never edit a database or marker. I/O, permission and contention failures grant no discard authority. A newer unsupported Store stays refused.

Workspace removal remains the native pinned skill's separately authorized exact-worktree operation. It deletes the complete selected `.podway` tree, preserves Git and uses `podway.workspace-removal-result/v2`. Reset, installation and managed-file updates do not imply removal authority.

## Ouroboros

Official source: `https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros`. Python package: `ouroboros-ai`. Support stable releases `>=0.51.1` without an upper bound. Verify the interfaces needed by the requested workflow through this host's plugin integration. Seed QA in 0.53 is advisory; do not add a blocking QA-until-PASS loop.

### Package and Plugin Discovery

The CLI is installed once per user. Ouroboros ships its Claude Code integration as a plugin rather than as user-scoped skills, so `/ouroboros:interview`, `/ouroboros:pm`, `/ouroboros:seed`, `/ouroboros:qa`, and the MCP server all arrive together with it. A copy of an Ouroboros skill in a user skill root neither satisfies readiness here nor counts as a duplicate of the plugin's own. Install the plugin from its own marketplace as a separate approved mutation:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Q00/ouroboros
claude plugin install ouroboros@ouroboros
```

The plugin declares its server as `plugin:ouroboros:ouroboros` and launches it through `uvx` in an isolated environment pinned away from the CLI's own MCP 1.x install, so `uv` must already be present. The observed launch command is:

```text
uvx --isolated --python >=3.12 --from ouroboros-ai[mcp] ouroboros mcp serve --runtime claude-cli --llm-backend claude_code
```

That resolution is independent of the pinned `uv tool install` below and can select a different version, so report the CLI version and the server separately and never treat one as evidence for the other.

Global setup owns the Ouroboros CLI here but not its Claude Code integration, which arrives as a plugin rather than as per-home rules and skills: `inspect_global_tools.py --component ouroboros` reports the CLI version and the plugin-scoped MCP registration through the project inspector's probe, and installing or upgrading the plugin itself belongs to `claude plugin`. This artifact bundles no Ouroboros release-freshness lookup, so disclose `https://pypi.org/pypi/ouroboros-ai/json` before any read-only request against it, exclude prereleases and withdrawn releases, and resolve and approve an exact package version; never install a moving range.

### Independent Inspection

Diagnose four independent components: the CLI through `ooo --version` once, the plugin integration and the effective MCP registration through `claude mcp get plugin:ouroboros:ouroboros` with a bare `ouroboros` fallback, plus runtime configuration derived from the plugin-scoped launcher. Run `ooo mcp doctor --json` only for a hand-registered entry that directly launches the selected `ooo` executable, because it inspects that package environment. These probes are local and read-only: they do not start an MCP server, contact a provider, initiate authentication, or make a network request, though the direct MCP doctor may inspect bounded local authentication-readiness metadata without exposing credential material. A healthy CLI does not prove that the plugin is installed, that the MCP runtime is configured, or that the server is reachable.

`ooo mcp doctor` reports the CLI's own package environment, not the plugin's server, so the inspector never runs it for the plugin-scoped launcher: a resolving `plugin:ouroboros:ouroboros` establishes configured runtime state as `plugin_launcher_configured`, and a registration that matches no supported launcher leaves runtime configuration `unverifiable` without probing an unrelated package environment. The supported layout keeps MCP 1.x in the CLI environment and runs the MCP 2 server in the isolated process the plugin launches; never resolve a failing base-environment `mcp_import` by adding MCP 2 to the CLI environment, which is the combination Ouroboros refuses.

Verify the plugin with `claude mcp get plugin:ouroboros:ouroboros`. A resolving name proves the plugin is installed and enabled, and therefore that its skills are reachable; `Status: ✔ Connected` additionally proves the server is usable. The skills do not need the server, so a resolved but unconnected entry is a degraded registration with the integration still intact, not a missing one. A bare `ouroboros` entry proves only that some MCP server was registered by hand and leaves the skills unaccounted for. Its shape is not checked here: `claude mcp get` prints a scope and a status rather than the transport fields upstream compares, so a hand-registered entry that connects is reported as a configured registration while the integration stays unverifiable. That is another reason the plugin is the only supported source.

The inspector probes that registration even when `ooo` is absent. Registration is `configured` only for a valid connected entry, `missing` only for a definite named-server-not-found response, `degraded` for disconnected, incomplete, malformed, timed-out, or failed probes, and `unverifiable` when the probed CLI is itself absent. Report only the normalized status and reason code; never expose raw registration output or configuration secrets.

### Approved Upgrade and Migration

Installation requires an existing `uv`. Show `uv tool install ouroboros-ai==<exact-version>` or the exact native upgrade command and package endpoints. Do not install `uv` as a side effect. Package installation or upgrade, plugin installation, and the selected configuration action are separate persistent mutations with separate approvals. Show the CLI action, the plugin action, rules and skills changes, MCP changes, expected shared Ouroboros configuration effects, backup policy, and verification together. One approval may cover all listed actions; changes outside that proposal require additional approval. Re-read targets before mutation and invalidate approval if they changed.

For full configuration, run only `ooo setup --runtime claude --non-interactive`: it installs and prunes the packaged rules and upstream Ouroboros skills for the selected runtime and writes the runtime and LLM backend into `~/.ouroboros/config.yaml`, and it deliberately registers no MCP server, because that profile cannot share the isolated server process the plugin launches; omit `--mcp-mode`, which selects another host's MCP configuration mode. Do not run `ooo setup refresh` before full setup. Offer refresh only as a separately approved rules-and-skills repair alternative when full setup is not selected. Refresh does not prune obsolete managed artifacts; if those remain, propose full setup with its complete effects. Do not copy or patch upstream skill content. The plugin is therefore the only supported source of the server: never hand-register a plain `ouroboros` entry to compensate.

Report a legacy user-scoped Ouroboros skill copy as a migration candidate, not as removal authority, and only when no current configuration action owns it: whatever the full setup above installs or prunes for the selected runtime belongs to that action and is never a migration candidate. Compare a remaining copy against verified upstream content before including it, show the exact paths and the backup and removal steps in the migration proposal, and install and verify the plugin before removing only approved legacy copies. Never delete unrelated shared skills.

### Completion and Runtime Switching

Verify package version, plugin registration, effective registration, and, when safely observable in the active host, live MCP tool exposure after each action. The read-only inspector reports configuration readiness and leaves `live_runtime` as `not_observed`. A Claude Code restart may be required after skill or MCP changes; after one, use safely observable host evidence to confirm the running server. Tool exposure alone does not prove the process environment. If that evidence is unavailable, report it explicitly rather than claiming runtime verification.

No setup action authorizes a provider call, authentication, repository-source transmission, `auto`, `run`, `ralph`, `evolve`, Seed creation, or an Aquarium design workflow. Do not switch accounts automatically or clear persisted quota-pause state. A correct plugin registration does not by itself prove an earlier usage-limit failure is resolved.
