# Herdr review supervision

The upstream `/herdr` skill and installed CLI own native syntax, pane and agent
control, submission, waiting, output reads and recovery. Aquarium supplies the
target and complete Review Brief, admits the report and adjudicates its content.
Review semantics belong to [review-contract.md](review-contract.md); native
control remains upstream-owned. Do not emulate Orca Run, Task, Dispatch, Delivery or settlement objects.

## Readiness and caller context

Require both the Herdr client and server at
[v0.9.3](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/releases/tag/v0.9.3) or newer, and the
installed upstream skill. The
[v0.9.3 skill](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/blob/v0.9.3/skills/herdr/SKILL.md)
documents the qualification baseline; it is not a required fixed skill version.
Accept later versions without an upper bound and use the installed native
contract. Inspect client, server, skill and requested reviewer readiness
independently; a version string cannot prove all four.
The baseline does not establish what is installed or running on the host.

Use the [catalog](tool-catalog.md#herdr) for selected-route setup diagnosis and
the [migration contract](herdr-migration.md) for legacy state. Peer routes do not
acquire Herdr prerequisites.

Before any session inspection or control, require `HERDR_ENV=1`. If absent,
return the selected route's prerequisite gap. A tool shell may lack inherited
context; resume from the intended managed pane or obtain the user's actual
caller context without inspecting another client's focused session or creating
a replacement backend. Within Herdr, learn current syntax
through `herdr --help` and the agent and pane groups; use `herdr status` before
depending on server features. Unequal client/server versions are eligible when
Herdr's native contract reports compatible capabilities. Native-reported
incompatibility requires separate host action, never an automatic upgrade or
lowered baseline.

Use explicit caller context or native returned IDs. Preserve the current local
session, canonical checkout and caller working directory. Remote review and
different workspace topology are outside this initial migration. Do not rely
on another client's focused pane or infer IDs from examples.

## Fresh reviewer and submission

Follow the current installed upstream skill's layout and geometry rules and
the user's explicit topology instructions. Aquarium prescribes no separate
split or new-tab policy. Preserve the caller's workspace, cwd and `--no-focus`
unless the user explicitly requests a change. Retain the native returned pane
and any created tab IDs. Verify the returned pane is an available shell and
record which pane and tab this operation created. Start one fresh uniquely
named agent of the explicitly selected kind in that pane. Pass requested native
model or effort arguments through the supported native interface, after `--`
where required. Verify the kind and identity actually established.

A startup-blocked or not-ready agent remains available for observation. Inspect
it, preserve the operation, and ask the user before answering approval or
question UI. Do not submit until that same requested agent is ready for input.
Do not switch kind, reuse another reviewer or create a second pane as recovery.

Submit the complete Review Brief and restrictions through `agent prompt --wait`
using the native syntax. Preserve the returned submission and wait outcomes.
A submission response alone proves neither observed work nor a completed review.
Correlate the requested fresh agent with observed activity. The native settled
state wait is lifecycle evidence, not a report or a per-turn completion receipt.
Use upstream waiting behavior without Aquarium retry caps or cumulative wait
budgets; a bounded observer timeout does not terminate the reviewer.

## Main reviewer and native children

Use the selected fresh agent as the main reviewer under
[review strategies](review-strategy-contract.md). It uses multiple native
subagents and adds UI expertise where applicable. Each receives the exact
candidate, Brief and bounded focus; collect actual reports through native
handles, then synthesize under the main reviewer's provenance. The caller
supervises the same Herdr operation; children do not create replacement panes
or independent review rounds. Retain available child references and evidence
without requiring hidden executor telemetry.

## Complete output and uncertain results

Use [result handoff](review-result-handoff.md) for production, submission and
recipient readback. Native output or host-returned reports need no extra file.
File fallback preserves the existing result and is not another assessment.

Read the same agent through the native agent surface, preferring unwrapped
output and expanding the native read when necessary. Require the complete
purpose-specific result and every completion criterion, not a screen excerpt.
When a larger read cannot recover the completed report, follow the upstream
fallback: ask the same reviewer to write its existing result as Markdown to an
allowed temporary location, then read the whole file. Use this only for output
recovery, never as initial delivery or a new assessment.

On timeout, `agent_prompt_stalled`, blocked UI or lost observation, inspect that
same agent and available output before any supported recovery. A timeout does
not prove submission failed. Never blindly resubmit, answer UI on the user's
behalf, or replace the agent. Retain earlier reports and findings. Replacement,
identity mismatch, missing output, `unknown` state or changed target prevents
completion; report `failed` or `incomplete` with every available native reference.

An embedded route change needs explicit authority and authoritative safe state
under the shared routing contract. Keep the current operation while active or
uncertain, and preserve findings, consumed ordinals and remaining correction
authority. A failed or incomplete operation consumes no assessment ordinal.

## Review output boundary

Review-related temporary files, native state, tool output and reports may use
external temporary locations or Git-ignored runtime paths in the checkout.
Examples such as `/tmp`, `/private/tmp` and `$TMPDIR` are not an allowlist;
applicable repository temporary-file guidance still applies. Select an allowed
location under that guidance for the output-recovery fallback. This permission
does not cover tracked or non-ignored files, Git state, or a symbolic link that
writes into a protected path. Report retained files used to deliver the result;
routine temporary output needs no inventory or automatic cleanup.

## Admission and pane disposition

Admit completion only when readiness, fresh reviewer identity, submission/activity
correlation, applicable target and Brief, and the complete result are established.
The result includes the expected children's roles, statuses, reports or native
report references, and the main synthesis, including UI coverage when applicable.
A missing required child report leaves the operation incomplete; preserve its
available references and report the gap.

Before admission, recheck the applicable Git target through the authorized
read-only Git surface. For `staged`, confirm the live HEAD-to-index transition
still matches the inspected candidate; for committed targets, retain the
resolved object basis. A changed mutable target prevents approval. This does
not create a fingerprint, snapshot or guarantee that bytes stayed unchanged
between reads.

Record bounded native references and outcomes separately from technical findings
and workflow acceptance. Use `backend-check-result=not-provided`; Herdr provides
no backend CI or Aquarium immutable-capture guarantee.

After successful result admission and evidence recording, close only the pane
created by this operation, using the native pane command and its exact returned
ID. Verify its disposition. If this operation also created the tab and it is now
empty, close that tab under the upstream skill; it may already have closed with
the last pane. While active, failed, blocked or uncertain, leave the pane intact
for same-operation recovery or the user's decision. Preserve the caller's pane
and every pane or tab this operation did not create. Never close a workspace or
session, and never stop or restart the server.

Keep reports and transient identities under the [evidence residency contract](evidence-residency.md).
Do not promote them as Mulgae hardening-deferral evidence. Static checks do not
prove native agent behavior; qualification requires actual agent observations
and manual skill verification.
