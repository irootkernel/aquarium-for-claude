# Documentation Setup

> **Claude Code delegation:** when this skill, or a reference or Procedure node it follows, hands a step to another Aquarium skill — however it phrases the hand-off, and whether it writes `/aquarium:<name>` or names the skill bare — read that skill's `SKILL.md` in full from this plugin (`../<name>/SKILL.md` from this skill's directory) and follow it as the delegated step instead of calling the Skill tool. Claude Code reserves most Aquarium skills for the user to type: it refuses the Skill tool for them and, once it has refused, forbids carrying out their workflow any other way. When you hand such a step to a subagent, put that file's absolute path in its assignment and have it read the file, because a subagent cannot load a gated skill through the Skill tool. Running another skill's bundled script is not a hand-off. A continuation request, routed repair, offer, or recommendation that the text has you return or report to the user is not a delegation: name its slash command, do not run it yourself, and stop where the text stops.

Read [commit-attribution.md](../../references/commit-attribution.md) for message formatting and change origins, within this skill's existing effect boundaries.

Establish documentation ownership and roadmap identity for one Git repository. This standalone setup workflow never stages, commits, pushes, publishes, creates Aquarium state, advances Podway, or replaces `/aquarium:task-document`.

Read [documentation-governance.md](../../references/documentation-governance.md), [directory-agent-guidance.md](../../references/directory-agent-guidance.md), [directory-guidance.md](references/directory-guidance.md) and [operations.md](references/operations.md). Read [profiles.md](references/profiles.md) for `bootstrap` or `adopt`, and [migration.md](references/migration.md) for `migrate`.

## Establish the Repository

1. Resolve one regular non-symlink Git root, read every applicable instruction file, and inspect HEAD, branch, upstream, staged, unstaged, untracked, conflicted, and worktree state.
2. Discover the public root README plus documentation, roadmap, specification, architecture, ADR, implementation, operations, TODO, existing dossier, deferred-feedback, archive, contract, validation, and language authorities before asking the user for facts. Inventory directory guides, other applicable instruction formats and the existing adoption declaration. When the selected operation maps directory guidance, inspect ordinary implementation sources in that scope to establish feature boundaries and canonical mappings.
3. Never open `.env*` or credential-bearing files, including credential stores, private keys, secret values and live tokens. Ordinary authentication implementation may be inspected when needed for the selected scope. Do not read ignored runtime evidence or emit repository document contents in the report.
4. Resolve this skill's directory and run `python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/inspect_docs.py --repository <git-root>`. Treat its `aquarium-docs-inspection/v2` JSON as conservative structural discovery only. It reports role ownership, explicit roadmap units and links, exclusions, and unambiguous structural conflicts; it does not interpret prose, decide migration eligibility, certify documentation completeness, or establish current product truth.
5. If Python is unavailable or inspection fails, report the gap and perform bounded read-only discovery manually. Do not install a runtime or dependency.

If more than one plausible canonical roadmap, delivery scope, or profile remains after discovery, use `AskUserQuestion` when available to ask only for the material ownership choice. Recommend `single-scope` for one delivery owner, `multi-scope` for independently delivered surfaces, and `legacy-adopt` when moving established authority is not approved.

## Select One Operation

- `audit`: report the current profile, public-versus-maintainer audience boundary, role owners, operations coverage, roadmap units, declared dossier and completed-outcome references, directory guidance and source mappings, adoption coverage, conflicts, missing roles, and unverifiable facts without drafting or mutation.
- `bootstrap`: propose a complete new documentation tree and first roadmap contract for a repository without an established documentation authority, with explicit directory-guide coverage and guides for existing implementation boundaries.
- `adopt`: preserve existing paths and identifiers, add or reconcile the root documentation index, and fill only required role gaps approved by the user. Propose directory-guide creation or reconciliation with declared coverage and preserved local instructions. Preserve and map existing dossier conventions, but never create or retrofit a work item or execution SOT; route new or revised epic definition to its owning work-definition workflow.
- `migrate`: change an adopted profile, documentation paths, or eligible roadmap identifiers through one reviewed mapping and exact diff, including affected directory-guide references.

Do not combine path migration and ID migration merely because both are possible. Include both only when the user selected both and the complete atomic diff is safer than either intermediate state.

## Propose the Change

For every mutating operation, produce one decision-complete proposal containing the selected profile, scopes, public-versus-maintainer audience boundary, role-to-path map, operations ownership, precedence, roadmap namespaces, ID policy, preserved existing dossier conventions, source-grounded feature-to-document mappings, guide coverage and gaps, preserved local instructions and managed blocks, exact target paths, moves versus new files, reference rewrites, validation commands, and exclusions. Show the complete file diff, including the coverage declaration, before requesting application.

Reuse repository content and validation patterns. Do not create placeholders that claim unknown architecture or specifications. A required index may record a bounded documented gap and its owner, but it must not invent product truth.

Use structured ask/answer when available to request `Apply exactly this diff`, `Revise proposal`, or `Do not apply`. Snapshot every affected tracked and untracked path, expected absent target and source used to establish the mapping before asking. Immediately before mutation, recheck those snapshots, the selected scope and reference inventory; discard approval if any target, source mapping, roadmap status or Git identity changed.

## Apply and Verify

Apply only the approved diff and preserve unrelated work. Do not run a formatter, generator, documentation server, test, or linter that may rewrite unrelated files unless that effect was disclosed and separately authorized where required.

Run the inspector again, repository-owned non-writing documentation checks, and `git --no-pager diff --check`. Report structural results separately from semantic review and runtime or generated-contract proof. An Aquarium inspection does not become repository-native CI and does not prove that documentation matches implementation.

Return the operation, profile, scopes, audience boundary, role owners, operations coverage, canonical roadmaps, ID policy, existing dossier references, directory-guide mappings, completed and remaining adoption coverage with the next area when partial, migration mapping if any, changed paths or a verified no-op, checks with exit codes, unresolved conflicts and unverifiable gaps, and separate staging, commit, and publication state.

When approved repository files changed, include their verified `change-origin` in the workflow result for a later separately authorized commit. Preserve an inherited coordinator owner when applicable. Report the origin separately from native receipts and closed JSON result schemas; it grants no staging or commit authority.
