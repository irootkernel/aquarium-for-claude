description: "Diagnose and configure Aquarium repository-local tooling and root agent guidance. Use when the user invokes /aquarium:dev-setup or asks to initialize, repair, or audit project configuration such as .podway, .mulgae, .gaori, Sorage Project setup, registration or binding, project MCP, Herdr review readiness or Orca workflow-state migration, AGENTS.md, or migration of an existing root CLAUDE.md. Use /aquarium:dev-setup-global for supported user-global development tool installation or updates. Aquarium plugin installation and updates belong to the host plugin-management flow."

# Repository Development Setup

Read [commit-attribution.md](../../references/commit-attribution.md) for message formatting and change origins, within this skill's existing effect boundaries.

Diagnose the repository first, propose only changes supported by repository evidence, and leave supported user-global development tool installation and updates to `/aquarium:dev-setup-global`. Route requests to install or update only the Aquarium plugin directly to the host's plugin-management flow without repository or global setup diagnosis.

This skill owns root AGENTS.md guidance and migration of an existing root CLAUDE.md. A general setup always reviews the complete guidance against the standard structure and behavior, then proposes a full reorganization where needed. `/aquarium:docs-setup` owns documentation structure, roadmap identity and explicit directory-guidance adoption or migration under the [shared contract](../../references/directory-agent-guidance.md). Root setup adds basic discovery and maintenance rules without adopting coverage, analyzing every feature or generating nested guides. Keep selected nested-guide work with `docs-setup`.

Read [podway-integration.md](../../references/podway-integration.md) only when Podway is selected by the request, repository guidance, or an Aquarium readiness requirement. Read the applicable sections of [the shared tool catalog](../../references/tool-catalog.md) for every repository component in scope. Read [agents-guidance.md](references/agents-guidance.md) whenever root operating guidance is in scope.

Do not use this skill for routine supported Procedure v2 observation, cancellation, discard or reset. Route those operations to `/use-podway`. Keep repository initialization, managed Procedure readiness, product-rename migration, and diagnosis of legacy Store, writer mismatch or retired configuration here. Hand off any separately approved runtime discard to `/use-podway` under the catalog's exact-worktree upgrade contract.

For an explicit Herdr review-readiness or migration request, use the
[Herdr catalog entry](../../references/tool-catalog.md#herdr) and
[migration contract](../../references/herdr-migration.md). Diagnose only that
selected route; general repository setup does not require or probe Herdr for
peer routes. Keep native host setup separate from an exact managed-source or
guidance update, and preserve custom Procedures and active snapshots.

Requests such as "configure Sorage for this repository" or "register this Sorage Project" select this skill and only the Sorage setup scope plus its direct prerequisites. Confirm the native Project identity and approve its exact mutation through the catalog. They do not authorize broker discovery, inbox or outbox reads, Handoff processing, or Memo reads and writes; those require an explicit operation through `/use-sorage`.

## Establish Scope From Evidence

1. Record the requested working directory (or current working directory when omitted), resolve it to one Git root, and inspect applicable instructions, branch, upstream, staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflict state.
2. Resolve this skill's directory and run `python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/inspect_tools.py --repository <git-root>`, adding only the flags required for repository components selected by explicit request, repository files or guidance, or an Aquarium readiness contract. Add `--include-podway` for Podway readiness and `--require-mulgae-mcp` when repository authority requires Mulgae MCP readiness to affect status. Start Sorage with the version-only probe; rerun the repository inspector with `--include-sorage` after disclosing native database and journal effects. The inspector skips a pre-Memo database, a missing database in a nonempty home, an incomplete or mismatched installation configuration, and an unverifiable state. After the catalog's v0.1.2 backup and restore preflight, add `--sorage-upgrade-preflight-complete` to identify a prepared pre-Memo database. On `upgrade_migration_required`, propose the separately approved native reconfiguration and rerun the inspector after it succeeds.
3. Select only evidenced repository components: Sanho workspace state; the selected Mulgae release's supported configuration, local configuration, bootstrap or refresh, and project MCP; Gaori repository config, active rules, ignore policy, and project MCP; Sorage Project binding and `.sorage/` ignore or tracking safety; Podway workspace, managed Procedures, migrations, and legacy recovery; and root AGENTS.md operating guidance with migration of an existing root CLAUDE.md.
4. Treat an absent optional tool component with no repository evidence as out of scope, not missing. An explicit component request adds that component to scope. General setup includes root guidance even when the files are absent. A request limited to a tool or a scoped continuation stays within that component and its direct prerequisites; it does not add a full guidance review. Honor explicit guidance exclusions, including bundle `agents_guidance: skip`.
5. Never ask the user to choose `Install and configure`, `Diagnose only`, or `Skip`, and never ask whether to `Show proposal`, `Diagnose only`, or `Skip`. Diagnosis is automatic. For tool configuration, report no change when ready and otherwise prepare the smallest exact proposal. For guidance, follow the whole-file review below.

If Python is unavailable or inspection fails, report the gap and perform the same read-only discovery manually. Do not install Python as a side effect. For adaptive launchers select an available compatible installed interpreter with YAML and `jsonschema`; do not assume the target repository contains Aquarium's development environment. Report missing imports as a diagnosed/manual prerequisite gap. Aquarium currently has no combined YAML/`jsonschema` environment installer; do not route it as an existing global component or install dependencies implicitly. Preserve managed canonical copies, adopted repository obligations, ignored exact local bundles and optional reusable library sources as distinct roles under [agents guidance](references/agents-guidance.md).

Never read credential values or open `.env*`, authentication, key, token, secret, or credential files. Use repository authorities, safe placeholders, and redacted native readiness only. Do not create or read `.aquarium` or another central selection file.

## Trust Canonical Global Installations

This skill may inspect an owning global executable only through the bounded version, compatibility, and readiness probes required to diagnose a selected repository component. For a canonical user-global skill path under the configured Claude Code skill root — `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` when that variable is set, otherwise `~/.claude/skills` — check only whether the path exists. Do not read its files, validate frontmatter, follow or reject symlinks, hash content, enumerate duplicates, contact upstream, or ask about installation or freshness.

Existence here means the repository workflow may use the global skill. Exact tree safety, provenance, duplicate detection, exact-upstream compatibility, and freshness belong exclusively to `/aquarium:dev-setup-global`.

Stop the dependent proposal when a required global executable or canonical skill path is absent, the owning CLI reports an incompatible runtime, a required user-global MCP registration is missing or degraded, or selected Sorage diagnosis reports `initialization_required` or `not_initialized`.

Return an exact continuation naming `/aquarium:dev-setup-global`, the missing, incompatible, degraded, or uninitialized global component, the canonical Git root and requesting workflow, the bounded observed reason code, and the exact repository request to resume after global repair.

Do not offer to install, upgrade, replace, or compare global state from this skill.

## Respect Host Mode

In Plan Mode, run every non-mutating repository diagnostic available and return exact proposed repository diffs or actions only for verified gaps. Never mutate files or native state. A diagnostic such as Sorage Project resolution that may open and migrate local state is deferred as an execution-phase prerequisite and must not become a question merely because it cannot run in Plan Mode.

Outside Plan Mode, use the same automatic discovery. Before each persistent action, show the exact command or complete diff, target paths, side effects, preserved state, verification, and backup policy when replacement or removal is involved. Establish `Choose a Backup Policy for Existing State` from the shared tool catalog before the first action-specific approval for an overwrite or removal, then obtain the action-specific approval required by the host. Re-read every target immediately before an approved mutation and invalidate stale approval.

Native Herdr host setup and successor session lifecycle remain with their upstream tool and owning workflow handler.

An explicit diagnosis-only request suppresses mutation proposals. A scoped continuation inspects only the named repository component and its direct prerequisites.

## Configure Repository Components

- Preserve the existing Sanho workspace, Mulgae, Gaori, Sorage, and Podway version, validity, approval, backup, and verification rules in the shared catalog, but apply only their repository-local portions.
- For an ordinary request without explicit MCP scope, prefer global Mulgae and Gaori registrations. For a bundle target, use its effective `global_mcp` and `local_mcp` lists as exact scope intent. Pass `--expected-mulgae-mcp` and `--expected-gaori-mcp` with `global`, `local`, or `none` to the inspector for selected tools. A wrong effective scope is a mismatch even when another registration is valid; `none` is unrequested and does not hide existing tools. Create, change, or remove a registration only under its existing action-specific approval, using the user configuration for global scope and the project `.mcp.json` for local scope, and preserve unrelated Claude Code configuration.
- For a bundle target with `sorage_project_slug`, compare it to the native resolved Project slug and binding kind. An existing different binding requires a bounded proposal, not a silent rebind. An omitted slug follows native discovery and identifier approval. Compare `mulgae_artist` with the effective enabled roles: `true` requires artist alongside the six non-UI roles, while `false` requires those six without artist. Propose an exact native configuration change for a mismatch; preserve provider, model, credential, and role-assignment choices and obtain the normal configuration approval. Do not infer UI intent from a path name.
- For Sorage, do not run doctor or Project resolution in Plan Mode because native paths may write local database or journal state. Outside Plan Mode, disclose their bounded side effects before requesting the probes. A missing or empty home and a database already carrying the Project Memo migration need no upgrade preflight. An existing pre-Memo database needs the completed backup and restore drill before its separately approved migration; a missing database or incomplete installation configuration needs recovery, and an unverifiable state remains deferred. Keep migration reconfiguration with `dev-setup-global` as a distinct global action. Initialization remains global; Project add, bind, rebind, unarchive, and repository ignore changes remain local and separately approved.
- For Podway, keep source provenance and handler-contract compatibility separate. Preserve every same-ID customization, but report readiness only when native validation and the required structural handler contract both pass. Show exact canonical replacement diffs for an incompatible customization; never overwrite it or reinterpret an admitted session. Keep session lifecycle changes outside setup. Diagnose legacy or mismatched runtime here and hand any separately approved discard to `/use-podway`. Managed-Procedure removal retains its destructive-action approval.
- Never stage, commit, push, authenticate a provider, transmit source, start a review or test, or invoke a workflow as part of setup.

## Reconcile Repository Guidance

Review the complete AGENTS.md and any existing root CLAUDE.md during general setup or an explicit guidance request. Reuse verified repository facts while assessing structure, behavior, duplication, and project-specific constraints. Check for Claude instruction files from the requested working directory through the Git root and its ancestors that prevent default AGENTS.md loading. Read only the root CLAUDE.md for migration; check other blocking files by existence alone. If a blocker would remain after root CLAUDE.md removal, report it, withhold that removal proposal, and do not report guidance ready. Continue independent setup components. An explicit diagnosis-only request reports findings without drafting a proposal.

When a change is needed:

1. Preserve the meaning of repository-specific rules, applicable stricter constraints, unrelated content, and tool-managed blocks. Resolve actual semantic conflicts with the user.
2. Reorganize the full instruction body around the standard in `agents-guidance.md`, including its seven core behaviors and mandatory commit-message authority. Rewrite and consolidate common prose, move rules to their proper sections, and remove duplication; do not limit the proposal to small additions or preserve the old arrangement for its own sake.
3. Include tool references only for evidenced repository integrations and canonical global skills that exist. Do not inspect those global skill contents.
4. Show one complete AGENTS.md diff together with the proposed removal of an existing root CLAUDE.md only when no other loading blocker remains.
5. Apply only that exact diff under authorization that covers it and after a fresh target snapshot and loading-blocker check from the requested working directory. Use existing approval when it covers the displayed changes; otherwise obtain approval once.

When the full review establishes that AGENTS.md already satisfies the standard and root CLAUDE.md is absent, report no guidance change and any loading blocker as an unresolved gap. Equivalent wording does not require a rewrite. Guidance approval never authorizes tool setup, staging, commit, or publication.

## Bundle and Continuation Intake

A `dev-setup-bundle` handoff must name the requesting skill, manifest digest, target index, canonical Git root, effective tools, effective `global_mcp` and `local_mcp` lists, `sorage_project_slug` (or null), `mulgae_artist` boolean, and repository-guidance policy. When guidance is proposed, it must also supply the separately resolved requested working directory. Verify that directory still belongs to the canonical Git root and use it as the starting point for Claude loading-blocker checks. If it is missing or mismatched, stop guidance work for that target without substituting the root; continue independent components. Accept the full effective tool list only as target intent: process repository components and guidance here, while the bundle owner sends the global union once to `/aquarium:dev-setup-global`.

Reject unsupported tools, malformed or conflicting MCP scope lists, invalid Sorage slugs or artist values, or any request to read the manifest. Preserve per-target partial failure and return `ready`, `partial`, `failed`, `declined`, or `skipped` with an exact resumption request.

## Report

When approved repository files changed, include their verified `change-origin` in the workflow result for a later separately authorized commit. Preserve an inherited coordinator owner when applicable. Report the origin separately from native receipts and closed JSON result schemas; it grants no staging or commit authority.

Report selected and out-of-scope repository components, diagnostic evidence, proposed or completed repository changes, deferred side-effectful diagnostics, global continuation gaps, verification, preserved worktree state, and whether staging, commit, or publication occurred. Do not report a global component as current or exact-upstream-verified; that claim belongs to `/aquarium:dev-setup-global`.
