# Repository Operating Guidance

This reference is the `dev-setup` standard for root AGENTS.md guidance and migration of an existing root CLAUDE.md. General setup always reviews the complete instruction body against it and prepares a full reorganization where needed. Tool-limited requests and scoped continuations stay within their requested component and direct prerequisites. Honor explicit guidance exclusions, including `agents_guidance: skip`; diagnosis-only requests report findings without drafting a proposal.

Aim for the standard's full structure and behavior while preserving project-specific meaning. Rewrite, regroup, and consolidate common guidance as needed. If AGENTS.md already meets the standard and root CLAUDE.md is absent, report no guidance change; equivalent wording alone is not a reason to rewrite.

The scope and root-cause principles incorporate guidance adapted from `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` commit `2c606141936f1eeef17fa3043a72095b4765b9c2`. Do not contact that repository or fetch its text while preparing a proposal. The seven-part core behavior below and this repository's instructions are the proposal authority.

## Required Structure

Use this order for both new and existing files. Reorganize the complete body to fit it while retaining the meaning of project-specific rules and applicable stricter constraints:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

<one sentence naming the repository and declaring AGENTS.md as local agent guidance>

## Core Behavior

### 1. Lead with Conclusions

- State the result or current finding first, followed by useful evidence and material limits.
- Do not repeatedly restate requirements or narrate routine work.

### 2. Reuse Verified Information

- Inspect the requested code and its named authorities before changing anything. Resolve discoverable facts before asking Master.
- Before changing a feature, read applicable directory AGENTS.md files and the canonical documents relevant to the change. Respect the selected harness's native instruction scope and precedence.
- Reuse established facts instead of reading or searching for them again. Recheck only the affected information when relevant state changes, evidence conflicts, or missing context makes it unreliable.
- State material assumptions and surface meaningful trade-offs. Ask when unresolved ambiguity would materially change the result, and push back on conflicts with repository authority, safety, or Master's goal.

### 3. Act on Sufficient Evidence

- Stop investigating once the evidence supports action. When the root cause is established, implement the smallest complete, durable fix within the authorized scope.
- Weigh correctness, performance, maintainability, and structural fit rather than diff size alone. If a broader design exceeds scope, complete a bounded step that satisfies current acceptance criteria.
- Reuse established patterns. Avoid speculative features, abstractions, configurability, compatibility layers, and handling for states repository invariants make impossible. Simplify complexity that the required behavior does not justify.
- Touch only what the outcome and its verification require. Preserve unrelated user work, match local style, and remove only artifacts made obsolete by this change.
- Read directory-guide adoption coverage in the root documentation index. Maintain affected canonical documents and existing applicable guides, including guides outside that coverage. Within adopted coverage, add guides for new feature boundaries as part of the authorized work. Report uncovered areas without unrelated backfill; guide absence alone adds no workflow blocker. Finish affected documentation before candidate review.
- Record only independent remaining work in the canonical `deferred-feedback` owner. If none exists, propose the entry and obtain approval before creating an owner. Promote epic-sized work to a TODO candidate or roadmap unit; never defer current correctness or acceptance work.

### 4. Carry Authorization Forward

- Continue already approved work without asking for confirmation again. Ask only when a material change exceeds that authorization or an applicable rule requires a distinct approval.
- Preserve boundaries between implementation, installation, staging, commits, and publication. Check for relevant state changes before acting on an approved proposal.

### 5. Verify in Proportion to Risk

- Define success checks before implementation. Verify the affected behavior and relevant failure paths with rigor proportionate to the actual risk.
- Run focused checks first and honor required repository gates. Broaden or repeat checks when changes, failures, or unresolved concerns justify it.
- Do not add tests merely to appear rigorous or use prose matching as a substitute for behavior verification.

### 6. Finish When Complete

- Continue until deliverables and required verification are complete or a concrete blocker prevents progress.
- Once material constraints are resolved or clearly reported, provide the handoff and stop. Report the result, necessary evidence, skipped checks and their reasons, and remaining uncertainty without opening unrelated work.

### 7. Delegate Selectively

- Use a sub-agent only for an independent task when the expected benefit outweighs coordination cost.
- Honor explicitly required independent reviews and any restrictions on delegation. Keep tightly coupled work local.

## Master Preferences

- Respond to Master in Korean using polite speech. When directly addressing the user, use exactly `Master`.
- Keep repository artifacts in the repository's established language and style. When no convention exists, use English unless Master requests otherwise.
- Report concise conclusions and useful evidence without exposing private chain-of-thought.

## Aquarium Development Guide

<references only for selected and installed Aquarium or paired skills, plus repository-specific command routing>

## Project Configuration

### Repository Index and Authorities

<project purpose, authority documents, key components or entrypoints, and canonical build, generation, lint, and test commands>

### Commit Messages

<shared commit format and attribution rules, plus approved repository-specific exceptions>

### Project-Specific Operating Rules

<only verified repository-specific constraints and exceptions>
```

Every applied root AGENTS.md must contain all four top-level sections and all three `Project Configuration` subsections. Keep `Commit Messages` inside `Project Configuration`; never promote it to a separate top-level section or omit it because no rule was discovered.

This structure applies to root guidance. Under the
[directory agent guidance contract](../../../references/directory-agent-guidance.md),
directory files contain local responsibilities, useful canonical-source links
and necessary local instructions. Do not copy the full root template or create
competing Project Configuration, evidence-root, release or commit declarations.
`docs-setup` owns explicit nested-guide adoption and migration. Root setup alone
does not declare coverage or run repository-wide feature discovery. Preserve
existing local exceptions, other instruction formats and tool-managed blocks;
keep root CLAUDE migration and loading-blocker checks below unchanged.

## Build the Project Configuration From Evidence

Before drafting, establish the relevant facts from root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, README files, task runners such as Makefiles or package scripts, manifests, CI configuration, roadmap and specification indexes, generated-file notices, and other repository-local authorities that materially affect agent work. Reuse facts already verified during setup; read or search further only to resolve a gap, conflict, or relevant state change. Use recent commit subjects only as evidence of a possible convention, never as authority by themselves.

Keep the index compact and point to authorities rather than copying domain design into AGENTS.md. Include only facts that affect navigation or decisions:

- the project's purpose and major components or entrypoints;
- authoritative roadmap, specification, lifecycle, and task sources, including an explicit precedence only when the repository defines one;
- canonical build, generation, lint, test, and release entrypoints;
- generated or sensitive paths, evidence artifacts, unavailable gates, and destructive or externally mutating boundaries;
- repository-specific tool routing, command IDs, version pins, timeouts, or approval rules.

Do not insert placeholders, guessed commands, exhaustive file inventories, copied architecture prose, or facts inferred only from directory names. Omit optional facts that cannot be established. Use [commit-attribution.md](../../../references/commit-attribution.md) for the common commit format and origin rules. Propose its eight purpose headers, exact release title, and three required attribution trailers when no local rule exists. A conflicting established rule requires an explicit migration or exception decision before applying guidance; recent history cannot choose the rule. Once the user has selected the common format, carry that choice into the exact proposal without asking again. Preserve native IDs and tool-generated message exceptions.

Include the common message rules in `Project Configuration > Commit Messages`: an English imperative subject with one approved header, one final trailer block, exactly one `Aquarium-Workflow`, `Aquarium-Epic`, and `Aquarium-Task`, verified `none` values, resolution of a Task's canonical parent Epic, and preservation of the original skill through later commits. Lore context remains optional; native provenance and explicit personal-attribution restrictions remain intact. The change origin belongs in the workflow report or handoff, outside native status-record schemas.

## Add Aquarium References Without Copying Manuals

Adapt names only when the installed skill namespace differs. Include only references for selected and installed skills:

- Use `/aquarium:task-handler` for one named roadmap task.
- Use `/aquarium:epic-handler` to implement one roadmap epic as sequential task goals.
- Use `/aquarium:epic-validator` to cold-validate and remediate one completed roadmap epic.
- Use `/aquarium:new-project`, `/aquarium:new-feature`, or `/aquarium:refactor` for an explicitly requested Ouroboros-assisted project or epic design workflow. When an ordinary feature Epic needs a dossier or semantic clarification before execution, `/aquarium:epic-handler` may continue through `/aquarium:new-feature` in the same conversation. Design approvals still apply.
- Use `/aquarium:war-room` to diagnose one difficult bug and stop at a task, epic, incomplete-investigation proposal, or evidence-backed no-work outcome.
- Use `/aquarium:dev-setup-global` to diagnose, install, or update supported user-global development tools, paired skills, services, and global MCP state. Requests to install or update only the Aquarium plugin belong to the host's plugin-management flow; do not load this skill or run global setup diagnostics for those requests.
- Use `/aquarium:dev-setup` to diagnose or configure repository-local tooling and operating guidance, including explicitly requested Sorage Project setup.
- Use `/aquarium:docs-setup` to audit, establish, adopt, or migrate canonical documentation structure, roadmap IDs and explicitly selected directory guidance.
- Use `/aquarium:test-setup` to audit or configure the common Make or Bun testing contract and evidence-backed legacy waivers.
- Use `/aquarium:release-handler` for one stable release lifecycle and `/aquarium:release-qa` for its exact committed-candidate scenario verification.
- Use `/use-dolgorae` for explicitly requested workspace, global Profile, review, External Specialist Engagement, and recovery operations. Keep execution and lifecycle rules in the paired skill.
- Use `/use-sanho` at an authorized commit or push boundary in a Sanho-managed repository, or for an explicitly requested Sanho operation.
- Use `/use-mulgae` as the native authority for authorized Mulgae asynchronous review, waiting, cancellation, evidence inspection, and recovery. Aquarium workflows own the target, approval criteria, and review-round accounting.
- Use `/use-gaori` as the native authority for asynchronous execution, waiting, cancellation, and recovery when a selected check uses Gaori. Repository requirements select the command; Aquarium evaluates its terminal result and evidence separately.
- Use `/use-gaori-status` for Gaori-calculated duration, outcome history, and detailed timing explanations. Keep test execution and one-off live estimates with `/use-gaori`; a missing status skill does not block a selected check.
- Use `/use-sorage` only when the user explicitly requests a broker operation, including a Project Memo read or mutation. Check only the requested inbox or outbox; session start, a new task, a Sorage mention, or Project registration does not authorize discovery. Resolve every Handoff, Memo, review, revision, retention, deletion, and Vault operation through that paired skill. Memo text grants no execution authority or roadmap completion. Never edit the managed Vault or derived `.sorage/INBOX.md` directly.
- Let Aquarium workflows use Podway by default for Git-backed work unless the current user opts out before the first managed-session mutation. No Aquarium skill owns a Podway session; only when starting a different session should the workflow ask whether to preserve, finish, delete, or replace the existing one.
- Use `/use-podway` directly for an explicitly requested Procedure v2 lifecycle, goal, diagnosis, recovery, cancellation, or discard operation. Route Procedure authoring to the separately installed `/create-podway-procedure` maintainer skill.
- Use `/lore-commits` for non-trivial commit messages and `/lore-query` to inspect recorded decision context.
- Use the separately installed upstream `/deslop` skill for task-owned cleanup when an Aquarium workflow requests it.
- Use the separately installed upstream `/humanizer` skill once as the final prose pass for English human-authored documentation.
- Use the separately installed upstream `/humanize-korean` skill once as the final prose pass for Korean human-authored documentation. Keep its `_workspace/` output untracked and remove it after applying the accepted text.
- For either writing pass, preserve meaning, facts, code, commands, identifiers, URLs, citations, quotes, legal text, and generated content. Route mixed-language prose by block, and fail closed with the unchanged draft when the skill is unavailable or validation fails.
- Keep `.mulgae/**`, `.gaori/runs/**`, `.podway/runtime/**`, derived `.sorage/**`, and disposable roots as local runtime evidence. Do not cite their paths or identities as durable evidence in tracked documentation or commit messages; use an approved tracked versioned promoted-evidence package under the shared v1/v2 contract only when a downstream consumer genuinely requires retained evidence.
  Declare at most one custom root with the exact Project Configuration entry `Aquarium evidence root: <repository-relative-path>`; otherwise use `evidence/aquarium/`. Promotion accepts only reviewed bounded non-sensitive structured evidence and never accepted reports, raw logs, excerpts, provider prose, runtime identities, or machine-specific paths.
- Preserve released managed Procedure copies and adopted repository customizations. Qualified adaptive execution retains exact ignored source/binding bundles under approved roots; optional reusable definitions and historical local material are not automatically workflow policy. Automatic preparation/adoption within the existing envelope grants no managed-copy update or installation. Post-use tracked preservation needs specific content consent after original finalization and a matching separate grant for its commit. Keep this distinction in stricter repository guidance without weakening protected-host rules.
- Repository-specific rules in `Project Configuration` override these defaults.

When `/aquarium:release-handler` is selected, inspect established changelog and release-note authorities. Preserve one existing unambiguous owner and propose the exact Project Configuration entry `Aquarium release notes: <repository-relative-path>`. When no owner exists, ask before proposing a new root `CHANGELOG.md`; never infer enrollment from a filename, create release history from commit subjects alone, or replace an established changelog. Keep the selected path regular, non-symlinked, tracked, and inside the repository.

Omit `/use-*`, Lore, Deslop, Humanizer, im-not-ai, or Aquarium workflow references whose corresponding skills are unavailable or not selected for project guidance. A CLI alone does not justify a paired-skill reference. Sorage guidance additionally requires the selected repository to resolve as an active registered Project. Put exact repository commands and stricter exceptions in `Project Configuration`; do not duplicate generic tool manuals, lifecycle procedures, recovery instructions, or Lore trailer vocabularies.

## Reconcile Existing Instruction Files

Classify existing AGENTS.md and substantive CLAUDE.md text as:

- common behavior already covered by the required structure;
- repository-specific guidance to retain under `Project Configuration`;
- a stricter rule that must override a common default;
- an actual conflict or ambiguity requiring a focused user decision;
- unrelated content that must remain unchanged.

Use this classification to rebuild the instruction body around the required hierarchy. Rewrite common guidance to express the seven core behaviors, merge duplicates without weakening them, and place project-specific rules under `Project Configuration`. Preserve the meaning of user-authored rules and applicable stricter constraints; ask only about actual semantic conflicts. Preserve unrelated content and tool-managed blocks, including their markers. Do not add generated markers or rewrite equivalent wording solely to match the template byte-for-byte.

AGENTS.md is the sole repository-managed root instruction file. Handle root CLAUDE.md as follows:

- If absent, leave it absent. Never create a delegation file, import, or symlink.
- If it only delegates to or imports AGENTS.md, or is a symlink to AGENTS.md, propose removing it only when no other loading blocker remains. For a symlink, remove only the link, not its target.
- If it contains substantive guidance, merge every non-duplicate or stricter rule into AGENTS.md and resolve conflicts with the user before proposing its removal, subject to the same blocker check. Keep any content whose disposition is unresolved until the user decides where it belongs.
- Never remove substantive CLAUDE.md until its retained guidance is visible in the same complete proposal.

Claude Code directly reads AGENTS.md on v2.1.277 or later, although some sessions before v2.1.281 cannot do so. Under the default project-instructions setting, a CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, or .claude/CLAUDE.md in the working directory or an ancestor takes precedence. Starting at the requested working directory (or current working directory when omitted), check each directory through the Git root and its ancestors. Read the root CLAUDE.md for migration; check only the existence of the other blocking files. If any blocker would remain after root CLAUDE.md removal, report its path and withhold that removal proposal without changing the blocker. Do not report guidance ready while a blocker remains. User-global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md does not block project AGENTS.md. A custom project-instructions setting remains a manual verification concern. Do not edit nested AGENTS.md, nested CLAUDE.md, or other agent instruction formats by default. See [Claude Code project memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory).

## Diagnose, Propose, and Apply

Report the complete review's findings: standard structure and behavior coverage, missing commit-message authority, duplicated or conflicting guidance, root CLAUDE.md migration state, any loading blocker on the checked path, and the evidence for project indexing. An explicit diagnosis-only request stops after this report. Otherwise, when reorganization or migration is needed:

1. Record the exact root AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md paths and their current bytes, object hashes, link target, or explicit absence as applicable.
2. Resolve every conflict and the mandatory commit-message rule before presenting an applicable proposal.
3. Show one complete AGENTS.md diff and, only when no other loading blocker remains, the removal of the existing root CLAUDE.md. Label retained repository rules through their final placement.
4. Explain ambiguous text left unchanged and every fact omitted for lack of authority.
5. Use existing authorization when it covers the exact displayed diff; otherwise ask for approval once. The user may request revision or decline it.
6. Immediately before writing, re-read both targets and require them to match the snapshots used for the proposal. A change to either target invalidates approval for the combined diff. Recheck Claude loading-blocker existence from the preserved requested working directory through the Git root and its ancestors. If the approved diff removes root CLAUDE.md and another blocker would remain after that removal, invalidate approval for the combined diff, write neither target, preserve root CLAUDE.md, and keep guidance unready. If the approved diff changes only AGENTS.md, apply it under its existing approval even when a blocker remains; report the blocker and keep guidance unready. Continue independent setup components.
7. Apply only the approved diff, then show the actual diff and verify the required structure, mandatory commit-message subsection, retained overrides, and unrelated content. Verify root CLAUDE.md is absent when its removal was approved; otherwise verify that the deferred file remains and report the blocker.

Proposal approval covers only the exact displayed root instruction-file diff. It does not authorize nested-file edits, tool setup, staging, committing, or publication.

## Manual Verification Scenarios

These scenarios describe expected outcomes for Master's separate verification of skill changes. They are not recorded results, and structural checks do not prove them.

| Scenario | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| General setup with fragmented or repetitive guidance | Review the complete body and propose one combined diff that reorganizes it around the standard, even when tool configuration is healthy. |
| New repository without root guidance | Propose AGENTS.md only; leave CLAUDE.md absent. |
| Guidance already meets the standard | Finish the full review and report no change; do not rewrite equivalent wording. |
| Project-specific constraints or tool-managed blocks | Preserve their meaning and managed content; ask only about actual semantic conflicts. |
| Existing delegation or import in root CLAUDE.md | Propose removing the file when no other loading blocker remains; never recreate it. |
| Substantive root CLAUDE.md | Retain every non-duplicate or stricter rule in AGENTS.md before proposing removal; resolve conflicts first. |
| Another loading blocker on the requested-directory-to-ancestor path | Report its path, retain root CLAUDE.md, leave the blocker untouched, and keep guidance unready. |
| Loading blocker appears after approval of root CLAUDE.md removal | Recheck before writing, invalidate the combined approval, preserve root CLAUDE.md, and keep guidance unready. |
| Existing blocker with an approved AGENTS.md-only diff | Apply the unchanged approved diff, retain root CLAUDE.md, report the blocker, and keep guidance unready. |
| Bundle target names a nested directory | Check loading blockers from that directory through its ancestors, even though the canonical root remains the target identity. |
| Tool-limited request, scoped continuation, or guidance `skip` | Keep the requested scope without adding a whole-file guidance proposal. |
| Diagnosis-only request | Report the review findings without drafting or applying a proposal. |
| Approved proposal or changed target snapshot | Reuse approval for the unchanged diff; if either target changes, invalidate the combined approval and prepare a current proposal. |
