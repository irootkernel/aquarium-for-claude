# Epic Handler

Deliver one roadmap epic as a sequence of goal-centered task executions. Own the outcome, ordering, evidence, and commit boundaries without prescribing one implementation procedure. Do not invoke `/root-kernel:task-handler` or its phase skills; they separately strengthen the procedure around one user-guided task goal.

## Establish and Approve the Epic

Require one mutable Git repository, one canonical roadmap path inside that repository, and exactly one epic ID present in that roadmap. Reject task-only requests, multiple epics, requests without one canonical roadmap epic identity, and external roadmap authorities. Inspect another repository read-only only when the roadmap explicitly names it; never mutate or create a goal for it.

Before requesting approval:

1. Read repository instructions, the epic, every member task, linked authority, required artifacts, and explicit dependencies.
2. Inspect branch, upstream, HEAD, staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted state. Separate epic-owned work from existing work and record the starting revision.
3. Discover repository-native verification, documentation synchronization, Mulgae, lifecycle, and commit guidance.
4. Build a dependency DAG. Distinguish member-task edges from pre-epic local or explicit external prerequisites. For every prerequisite record repository, canonical ID, exact revision, lifecycle state, dirty state, evidence, and owner. An incomplete member-task predecessor determines execution order and does not block initial approval. A pre-epic or external prerequisite is satisfied only by committed work at the required revision with verified evidence; if unmet, stop before goal creation or mutation and report the owner and required sequence.
5. Order tasks by dependencies and then roadmap order. Split a cycle only when authority defines pre-validation and finalization; otherwise stop and report its nodes, owners, and missing authority.
6. Preserve successfully terminal tasks, start at the earliest non-terminal task, and retain every task for the final audit. Stop rather than replace a different active goal.

Produce one concise, decision-complete epic plan: goal and non-goals, dependency DAG, exact task order, requirement owners, expected task outcomes and commit boundaries, relevant checks, Mulgae targets, lifecycle changes, external handoffs, and known authority or environment gaps. Avoid prescribing phase order, file-by-file mechanics, or a full task implementation design unless the authority makes them necessary.

Ask once for explicit approval of the plan and execution envelope. Approval covers bounded implementation decisions, repository-authorized checks, disclosed Mulgae transmission, task and epic staging, one task-ID commit per task, and necessary remediation or closeout commits. It does not authorize amend, push, PR or release changes, live rollout, destructive actions, installation, another repository, or unrelated staging. Commit and upstream publication are separate states.

Do not create a goal, edit files, invoke providers, stage, commit, or alter external state before approval. Request renewed approval only when requirements, task membership or order, repository scope, product behavior, destructive impact, external actions, or safe diff isolation materially departs from the envelope.

## Complete Task Goals

For each non-terminal task in order:

1. Reconfirm every member-task predecessor is successfully terminal with its required commit and evidence, and recheck any pre-epic or external prerequisite at its exact revision. Stop on a gap; otherwise create or resume exactly one goal containing the task ID and required outcome. Omit a token budget unless the user supplied one.
2. Work from current authority and code toward the task goal. Choose the implementation, investigation, documentation, and verification sequence that best fits the repository and task; do not manufacture phase artifacts or pause for routine choices already inside the approved envelope.
3. Implement the complete task outcome, including runtime wiring, tests, generated or derived artifacts, durable documentation, and roadmap state that the authority requires. Preserve unrelated work.
4. Run proportionate repository-authorized checks. Focused green checks prove only mapped requirements; forbidden or unavailable database, E2E, live, or broad gates remain explicit evidence gaps and are never run merely because another workflow normally would.
5. Run Mulgae at least once on the latest complete task target, including task-owned staged, unstaged, untracked, generated, and derived files. Verify findings as hypotheses, fix every valid in-scope issue, rerun affected checks, and review the changed target again until no valid finding remains.
6. Treat Mulgae as complete only when `coverage_status=complete`, `ci_decision=pass`, `publication_status=committed`, the findings query succeeds, and zero unresolved valid findings remain. Provider success or exit status alone is insufficient.
7. Move the task to its defined successful state and commit one isolated task-owned diff under the task ID. Complete the goal only after the commit exists, no task-owned residue remains, and unrelated work is unchanged; then re-read roadmap, DAG, Git state, and evidence before advancing.

Use a fresh read-only subagent for an independent perspective when task risk or uncertainty merits it, but do not substitute that review for Mulgae or let it impose the `/root-kernel:task-handler` phase workflow.

Keep implementation snapshot, verification snapshot, Mulgae target, lifecycle state, commit ID, upstream publication, and external or live evidence distinct. Any code, test, durable documentation, generated, or derived change after verification or final Mulgae review makes affected evidence stale; the exact planned status-only roadmap transition is the sole exception. Do not advance after failed checks, evidence gaps required for completion, incomplete review, unresolved findings, unsafe staging, failed commit, or missing lifecycle evidence.

## Audit and Remediate the Epic

After all tasks are terminal, audit the latest committed epic state without an active goal or source mutation. Build a requirement-to-owner-to-production-to-test-to-document matrix across every task and inspect integration seams, consumers, persistence, concurrency, migrations, generated artifacts, recovery, operations, and roadmap consistency. Run only approved epic checks and one complete Mulgae review of the exact latest epic target.

Classify each verified gap by canonical requirement owner, not file count or edit location:

- A violation owned by one task remains task-owned even if that task is Completed or the fix crosses modules. Create a new goal for that task, obtain fresh verification and Mulgae evidence, and commit under its task ID.
- An epic seam invariant owned by no single task is cross-task. Create an epic remediation goal and commit the isolated correction under the epic ID.
- Work requiring another repository is external. Stop with its owner, exact revision, and missing evidence; do not edit it.

If ownership is ambiguous, stop before goal creation and report the missing authority. Process task-owned gaps in canonical task order, then cross-task gaps. After each remediation goal, discard the prior audit and audit again from scratch. When an external blocker is resolved, first revalidate the DAG at its new exact revision and restart the audit.

Only after a clean latest-snapshot audit and complete Mulgae evidence may one final epic closeout goal be created. Transition the epic to its successful state, perform authorized synchronization, and create an epic-ID closeout commit only for an actual isolated diff. Never create an empty commit.

## Commit Safely and Report

Before a non-trivial commit, reference `/lore-commits` and follow it when available. If unavailable, report that once, inspect `git log -5 --format=fuller`, and match recurring subject, body, and trailer structure without copying unrelated content. If fewer than five commits exist, inspect all; with none use a concise imperative subject. Repository-required IDs and prefixes override Lore, which never grants commit authority.

Immediately before each commit, confirm the reviewed implementation equals the staged diff except for its planned status-only transition and record the staged tree and blob identities. Afterward compare the commit with that snapshot byte-for-byte and inspect staged, unstaged, and untracked state for residue or hook changes. Do not amend without separate authority.

Do not create or read `.root-kernel-dev-skills` or other shadow state. Resume from roadmap, Git history and worktree, current goal, recoverable approval, repository evidence, and Mulgae records; request fresh approval when the envelope cannot be recovered.

At every stop and final handoff report current task and epic, dependency changes, completed and remaining goals, commits and roadmap states, checks and evidence gaps, Mulgae target and capture/findings/publication status, worktree boundaries, upstream publication state, and the exact next safe action.
