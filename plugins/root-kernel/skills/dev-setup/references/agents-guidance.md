# Reference-Based Instruction-File Guidance

Use this reference only after the user approves preparation of an instruction-file proposal, and apply it to the single target resolved by the skill.

## Minimal reference section

Adapt names only when the installed skill namespace differs:

```markdown
## Development skill references

- Use `/root-kernel:task-handler` for one named roadmap task.
- Use `/root-kernel:epic-handler` to implement one roadmap epic as sequential task goals.
- Use `/root-kernel:epic-validator` to cold-validate and remediate one completed roadmap epic.
- Use `/root-kernel:dev-setup` to diagnose or configure development tooling.
- Use `/lore-commits` for non-trivial commit messages and `/lore-query` to inspect recorded decision context.
- Repository-specific rules below override defaults from the referenced skills.

### Repository overrides

<only rules that actually differ from the referenced skills>
```

Omit a reference to a skill that is not selected or installed. Omit the override heading when there are no overrides.

## Classify existing guidance

Move or retain as an override only information that materially differs from the referenced skills, including:

- authoritative roadmap paths, lifecycle states, and task-ID normalization;
- exact test commands, permission limits, and Gaori command IDs or version pins;
- Sanho documentation ownership, check timing, project identity, conflict policy, or repository-specific exceptions;
- Mulgae role sets, provider routing, target selection, timeouts, artist inputs, or stricter authorization;
- commit subject prefixes and task-ID formats that override Lore's generic summary line;
- project-specific sensitive paths, generated sources, fallback behavior, and unavailable gates.

Replace duplicated common workflow, generic safety prose, Lore trailer vocabulary, and generic command examples with references. Preserve stricter rules. Preserve ambiguous text and call it out in the proposal rather than guessing that it is duplicate.

When a repository says Mulgae requires an explicit request, clarify whether explicit `/root-kernel:task-handler` invocation is the authorized task-scoped request; do not silently weaken the repository rule.

## Produce and apply the proposal

1. Record the exact target path and current file bytes or object hash.
2. Show a complete diff that labels retained overrides through their final placement.
3. Explain any ambiguous text left unchanged.
4. Request a second ask/answer decision for that exact diff.
5. Re-read the target before writing. Any change invalidates approval.
6. Apply only the displayed patch and show the resulting diff.

Do not insert generated markers around unrelated content, rewrite the entire file for formatting, or modify a second instruction file, a nested `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, or another agent instruction file by default.
